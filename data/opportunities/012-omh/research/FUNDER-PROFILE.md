### Strategic Priorities

1. **Maternal and Perinatal Health**: Community-based perinatal health models addressing health disparities in minority populations, particularly focusing on Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native women through the COPHI program. Addresses the critical disparity that Black women are 3x more likely and AI/AN women 2x more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to non-Hispanic White women.

2. **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Innovation**: Community-level innovations to increase preventive health services utilization by addressing SDOH barriers including housing stability, food security, transportation access, health literacy, and cultural/linguistic diversity in racial, ethnic, and Tribal communities.

3. **Health Equity Research and Data**: Supporting research that tests innovative solutions in CMS programs, policies, and practices affecting SDOH; advancing data availability regarding health disparities; and contributing to improved health outcomes for minority populations through evidence-based interventions.

4. **State and Community Partnership Models**: Demonstrating that partnerships between state offices of minority health/health equity and state health agencies can efficiently improve health outcomes in geographic "hotspots" with concentrated health disparities across focus areas including diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality, mental health, and cancer.

5. **Indigenous Health Innovation**: Research, education, service, and policy development addressing health disparities in American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander populations through the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health (CIIH).

### Target Populations

- Racial and ethnic minority populations (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander)
- Disadvantaged populations experiencing health disparities
- Low-income communities
- Geographically isolated or underserved communities
- Minority-serving institutions (HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, Tribal colleges)

## Strategic Notes

1. **NOFO Monitoring Essential**: OMH releases funding opportunities on rolling basis rather than fixed annual schedule. Successful pursuit requires weekly monitoring of grants.gov (search "Office of Minority Health" and CFDA 93.137, 93.296) and OMH website. Consider requesting customized funding search from OMH Information Specialists (https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/funding-search-request).

2. **Demographics as Competitive Advantage**: Miami-Dade County's population (70% Hispanic/Latino, 17% Black/African American) provides exceptional alignment with OMH target populations. Applications should emphasize documented health disparities in these communities and leverage local data on maternal mortality, chronic disease prevalence, and healthcare access barriers affecting minority populations.

3. **COPHI Represents Significant Opportunity**: $975K-$1.25M annually for 4+ years makes COPHI one of OMH's largest programs. FIU would need to expand NeighborhoodHELP's maternal/child services to include comprehensive Community-Based Maternal Support Services (COMSS) with trained doulas and CHWs providing pregnancy, labor/delivery, and postpartum support. Consider building this capacity proactively before next COPHI NOFO.

4. **CMS MRGP as Near-Term Entry Point**: April 1, 2025 deadline provides immediate opportunity if FIU qualifies as Hispanic-serving institution or similar MSI. Award amount ($212,500 over 2 years) is modest but establishes OMH relationship and generates preliminary data. Strong research question linking FIU Thrive SDOH screening to CMS program utilization or outcomes would be competitive.

5. **Community Innovations Program Best Fit for Current Capabilities**: NeighborhoodHELP's established SDOH navigation and community health worker model aligns perfectly with Community Level Innovations Initiative focus. FIU Thrive's AI-powered screening addresses "innovative approaches" criterion while NeighborhoodHELP provides community-based delivery infrastructure. Monitor for next NOFO cycle.

6. **State Partnership Strategy**: Engaging Florida Department of Health Office of Minority Health and Health Equity as potential partner for State Partnership Initiative could provide alternative route. Florida has documented health disparities in multiple "hotspot" areas including Miami-Dade. Partnership would combine FIU's research/evaluation capacity with state's policy influence.

7. **Evaluation Capacity as Differentiator**: Federal demonstration projects require rigorous evaluation and data collection. FIU's academic research capacity provides competitive advantage over community organizations lacking evaluation infrastructure. Applications should emphasize mixed-methods evaluation design, data management systems, and track record of research with minority populations.

8. **Cultural Competency Documentation Critical**: OMH places high priority on cultural and linguistic appropriateness. Applications must demonstrate staff diversity, language capacity (particularly Spanish and Haitian Creole for Miami-Dade), cultural competency training, and community advisory structures ensuring cultural relevance of interventions.

9. **Long Application Timeline Requires Early Preparation**: Federal NOFOs typically allow 60-90 days from release to submission. Given complexity of applications (often 50+ pages plus attachments), begin drafting key components now: community needs assessment with local health disparity data, partner letters of commitment, evaluation plan, organizational capability statements, and staff biosketches. Store these in opportunity folder for rapid response when NOFO releases.

10. **Sustainability Plans Increasingly Important**: OMH programs emphasize post-grant continuation. Applications should articulate specific strategies: diversified funding sources (state Medicaid, other federal programs, philanthropy), policy changes enabling sustained reimbursement for services, partnership agreements ensuring continued collaboration, and capacity building enabling community partners to continue work independently.
