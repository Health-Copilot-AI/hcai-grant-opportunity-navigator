## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas for OMH Applications

#### COPHI (Perinatal Health) Focus
- Prenatal SDOH screening and navigation for Hispanic/Black mothers
- Community doula program integrated with NeighborhoodHELP mobile health
- Postpartum depression screening and culturally tailored mental health support
- Breastfeeding support for minority mothers (lactation counseling, peer support)
- High-risk pregnancy care coordination (connecting NeighborhoodHELP to hospital perinatal centers)

#### Community Level Innovations (SDOH) Focus
- FIU Thrive AI-powered SDOH screening in NeighborhoodHELP mobile clinics
- Closed-loop referral system linking SDOH screening to community resources
- Food insecurity intervention (food pharmacy, nutrition education)
- Transportation barrier mitigation (rideshare partnerships, telehealth alternatives)
- Technology access equity (devices, connectivity for telehealth and patient portals)

### Potential Project Concepts

#### Concept 1: "Miami Mothers Thrive - AI-Enabled Perinatal SDOH Navigation"

**Target Program**: COPHI

**Overview**: Integrate FIU Thrive's AI-powered SDOH screening into NeighborhoodHELP's mobile maternal health services, identifying and addressing social barriers (food, housing, transportation, childcare) that prevent Hispanic and Black mothers from accessing prenatal/postpartum care. Community doulas trained in SDOH navigation provide culturally tailored support and linkage to resources.

**Key Components**:
- Prenatal SDOH screening at first NeighborhoodHELP visit
- Risk stratification (high SDOH burden → doula assignment)
- Community doula program (bilingual Spanish/Creole, culturally matched)
- Real-time resource navigation (food banks, WIC, housing assistance, transportation)
- Postpartum home visits integrating SDOH re-screening and maternal mental health
- COMSS integration via hospital partnerships

**Outcomes**: Reduce preterm birth, low birthweight, maternal mortality/morbidity among Hispanic/Black mothers in Miami-Dade

---

#### Concept 2: "Neighborhood Health Equity Hub - SDOH Screening to Action"

**Target Program**: Community Level Innovations

**Overview**: Deploy FIU Thrive SDOH screening platform in NeighborhoodHELP mobile clinics serving Miami-Dade's minority neighborhoods, creating "SDOH Screening to Action" workflows that connect patients to community resources in real-time. Community Health Workers serve as SDOH navigators, addressing barriers to preventive care (cancer screening, diabetes management, hypertension control).

**Key Components**:
- Universal SDOH screening for all NeighborhoodHELP patients
- AI-powered risk stratification and prioritization
- CHW SDOH navigation team (bilingual, community-based)
- Community resource network (food banks, housing, legal aid, transportation)
- Closed-loop referral tracking and follow-up
- Preventive care integration (mammography, colonoscopy, A1C, BP monitoring)

**Outcomes**: Increase preventive service utilization, chronic disease control, and health equity among Hispanic, Black, and Haitian populations

---

#### Concept 3: "Haitian Health Equity Initiative - Culturally Tailored SDOH + Perinatal Care"

**Target Program**: COPHI or Community Level Innovations

**Overview**: Partner with Haitian community organizations to deliver culturally and linguistically tailored SDOH screening, navigation, and perinatal health services to Miami-Dade's Haitian population. Address unique barriers including immigration status, language (Creole), cultural health beliefs, and mistrust of healthcare systems.

**Key Components**:
- Haitian Creole-speaking staff and doulas
- Culturally adapted SDOH screening (immigration, documentation, community networks)
- Trusted community partner co-location (Haitian churches, community centers)
- Perinatal health education rooted in Haitian cultural practices
- Mental health integration (trauma-informed, immigration stress)
- Community Advisory Board led by Haitian community members

**Outcomes**: Reduce maternal/infant health disparities and increase preventive care among Haitian population, a historically underserved minority group

---

### Differentiation Strategy

**What Makes FIU/HWCOM Stand Out**:

1. **AI + Community Infrastructure Combination**: Most applicants have either technology OR community reach—FIU has both. Thrive AI screening + NeighborhoodHELP delivery is a powerful, scalable model.

2. **Hispanic-Serving Institution Authenticity**: FIU isn't just serving Hispanic populations—it IS a Hispanic institution. Deep cultural competency, bilingual workforce, community trust.

3. **Academic Medicine + Community Health Integration**: Medical student/resident involvement creates workforce development pipeline AND sustainable model (academic mission ensures continuity).

4. **Miami-Dade Minority Demographics**: Perfect laboratory for minority health innovation—one of most diverse counties in US, with documented health disparities OMH prioritizes.

5. **Existing Infrastructure**: Many applicants will be building new programs—FIU is enhancing/expanding proven models (NeighborhoodHELP operational since [year], Thrive deployed).

**Gaps in OMH Portfolio This Could Fill**:

- **AI/Technology Integration**: Relatively few OMH grantees leverage AI for SDOH—opportunity to showcase innovation
- **Haitian Population Focus**: Underrepresented in OMH portfolio compared to Hispanic/Black populations
- **Academic Medical Center Model**: Many OMH grants go to CBOs—academic medicine brings research rigor and sustainability
- **Multi-generational Model**: Perinatal → pediatric → adult continuum addresses disparities across lifespan

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Federal Application Pitfalls

- **SAM.gov Expiration**: Registration expires annually—verify status well before deadline; renewal takes 2+ weeks
- **Generic SDOH Language**: OMH wants SPECIFIC interventions, not just "we'll address SDOH"—describe HOW
- **Missing Community Voice**: OMH prioritizes community engagement—show authentic partnership, not just service delivery TO communities
- **Insufficient Minority Health Disparity Data**: Document disparities with LOCAL data (Miami-Dade), not just national statistics
- **Weak Sustainability**: Don't just say "we'll seek future funding"—describe specific revenue sources, Medicaid billing, institutionalization
- **Overlooking Cultural Competency**: Generic cultural competency statements fall flat—describe SPECIFIC adaptations for Hispanic, Black, Haitian populations
- **Budget Disconnects**: Ensure budget line items match narrative activities (e.g., if narrative describes doula program, budget must include doula costs)

### COPHI-Specific Pitfalls

- **Ignoring COMSS**: COPHI prioritizes Community Maternal Safety Structure integration—must show how project connects to COMSS
- **Doula/CHW as Afterthought**: Doulas and CHWs should be CENTRAL to model, not add-ons
- **Missing Maternal Outcomes**: Must define measurable maternal and infant health outcomes (not just process metrics)
- **Insufficient Perinatal Focus**: COPHI is specifically PERINATAL health—prenatal through postpartum, not general women's health

### Community Level Innovations Pitfalls

- **Technology Without Community**: FIU Thrive AI screening is impressive, but must be paired with community infrastructure and relationships
- **SDOH Screening Without Navigation**: Identifying SDOH needs is insufficient—must show HOW barriers will be addressed
- **Missing Policy/System Change**: OMH wants demonstration projects that inform policy—articulate scalability and policy implications
