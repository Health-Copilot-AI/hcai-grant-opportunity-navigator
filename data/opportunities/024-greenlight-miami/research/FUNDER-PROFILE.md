## Engagement Strategy for FIU

### NOT a Grant Opportunity

GreenLight Fund Miami is **not** accepting grant applications. Organizations are identified through the Selection Advisory Council process and invited to participate. FIU should engage as a community partner, not an applicant.

### Recommended Approach

| Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Leverage existing investment** | FIU is already a founding investor; activate that relationship |
| **Connect through Phillip Lloyd Hamilton** | FIU representative on Advisory Council provides direct channel |
| **Build on Valeria connection** | Prior StartUp FIU Food collaboration creates warm introduction |
| **Position as community resource** | Offer data, research, infrastructure support to GreenLight and portfolio orgs |
| **Explore portfolio partnerships** | When organizations are selected, explore how Thrive or NeighborhoodHELP could support their work |

### Potential Value Propositions to GreenLight

1. **Research Partnership** - FIU could provide evaluation support for portfolio organizations
2. **Technology Platform** - Thrive could be offered to selected organizations needing care coordination
3. **Student Engagement** - Medical, public health, social work students as implementation support
4. **Community Trust** - NeighborhoodHELP's 15+ year presence in target communities
5. **Data & Analytics** - HCAI capabilities for measuring program impact

### Key Contacts for Outreach

| Contact | Role | Connection Type |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Valeria Perez-Ferreiro | Founding ED, GreenLight Miami | Prior FIU collaborator (StartUp FIU Food) |
| Phillip Lloyd Hamilton | FIU representative | Advisory Council member |
