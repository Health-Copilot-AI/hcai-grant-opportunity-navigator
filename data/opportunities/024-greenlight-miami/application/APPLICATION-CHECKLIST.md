# GreenLight Fund Miami - Engagement Checklist

**Model**: Invitation-Only Selection (NOT a Traditional Grant Application)
**Primary Engagement**: Community Partnership & Relationship Building
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: THIS IS NOT A GRANT APPLICATION

> **WARNING**: GreenLight Fund Miami operates via **invitation-only selection**, NOT open grant applications. They identify and recruit evidence-based nonprofits to scale in Miami based on their own research and vetting process.
>
> **DO NOT submit an unsolicited proposal.** This is not a funding opportunity FIU will "apply for" in the traditional sense.
>
> **CORRECT APPROACH**: Position FIU as a strategic community partner and resource to GreenLight Fund Miami and their selected grantees.

## STRATEGIC NOTES

### Why This Approach?

1. **Respects Their Model**: GreenLight Fund's selection process is intentional and research-based. Unsolicited proposals are counterproductive.

2. **Creates Real Value**: By positioning FIU as a resource to their grantees, you become useful rather than demanding.

3. **Opens Multiple Doors**: Even if FIU isn't a direct grantee, partnership with GreenLight orgs could lead to project funding and valuable collaborations.

4. **Long-term Relationship**: Building a genuine partnership now positions FIU well if GreenLight expands or creates new funding vehicles in the future.

5. **Demonstrates Understanding**: Showing that you understand their invitation-only model and respect their process builds credibility.

### Success Metrics (Not Grant Success, But Engagement Success)

- [ ] Established communication with Valeria Perez-Ferreiro
- [ ] GreenLight leadership understands FIU's Thrive platform and relevant capabilities
- [ ] At least one partnership discussion initiated with a GreenLight-funded organization
- [ ] FIU positioned as a trusted community resource for GreenLight's work
- [ ] Quarterly relationship maintenance established

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

- **DON'T**: Send unsolicited grant proposals
- **DON'T**: Try to "pitch" Thrive as a product to sell
- **DON'T**: Assume FIU is in their target pool without confirmation
- **DON'T**: Use boilerplate grant language or formal proposal tone in initial outreach
- **DON'T**: Make the conversation about FIU's funding needs; focus on how FIU can help their work
- **DON'T**: Ignore their invitation-only model or try to "game" their selection process
- **DON'T**: Contact multiple GreenLight staff simultaneously; work through primary contact

---

## IF THINGS CHANGE: Escalation Protocol

If GreenLight Fund approaches FIU with a direct funding opportunity or partnership proposal:

- [ ] **Immediately notify**:
  - [ ] Office of Research
  - [ ] Dean of College
  - [ ] Grants Administration
  - [ ] Project Lead / PI

- [ ] **Request clarification** on:
  - Nature of the opportunity (grant, partnership, service contract, research collaboration)
  - Timeline and deadlines
  - Required response or proposal
  - Who at GreenLight is the primary contact

- [ ] **Escalate appropriately** based on opportunity type:
  - Research partnership → Office of Research
  - Funding opportunity → Grants Administration
