## Notes for FIU/HCAI Alignment

### Relevance to NeighborhoodHELP

- Mobile health units align with NeighborhoodHELP's community-based care model
- Opportunity to enhance outreach to underserved Miami-Dade populations
- Training track could support student/resident involvement in mobile operations

### Considerations

1. **Membership Requirement**: FIU HWCOM would need NACHC Organizational Membership
2. **FQHC Status**: NeighborhoodHELP partnership with FQHCs may provide pathway
3. **Timeline**: Application deadline June 23, 2025 - plan accordingly
4. **Award Size**: $20,000 is modest but could seed larger initiatives

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Verify if FIU HWCOM or partner FQHCs have NACHC membership
2. Contact Jermaine Pope (jpope@nachc.org) for eligibility clarification
3. Review full PDF announcement and FAQ for detailed requirements
4. Identify which funding track best aligns with current mobile health needs
