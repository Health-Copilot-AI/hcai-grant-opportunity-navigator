## Key Messaging Points

- **CDC Priority Alignment**:
  - "This Accelerator Plan directly responds to CDC's commitment to addressing root causes of chronic disease through upstream SDOH interventions"
  - Emphasize focus on health equity and populations experiencing disparities

- **FIU Thrive Unique Value Proposition**:
  - AI-powered SDOH screening platform already operational

  - Existing relationships and trust with target communities
  - Track record of successful collaboration

- **Community-Based Participatory Approach**:
  - "Community members are not just advisors but co-designers of our Accelerator Plan"
  - Shared decision-making throughout planning process
  - Strategies grounded in community priorities and assets

- **Entry Point to Federal SDOH Funding**:
  - Planning grant positions FIU for larger implementation opportunities
  - Builds federal partnership with CDC NCCDPHP
  - Demonstrates readiness for chronic disease prevention funding

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Primary Focus: Community-Clinical Linkages + Food and Nutrition Security

**Concept Title**: "Strengthening Community-Clinical Linkages to Address Food Insecurity and Chronic Disease in Miami-Dade's Underserved Communities"

**Core Elements**:
1. **Domain 1 - Community-Clinical Linkages**:
   - Expand FIU Thrive SDOH screening to additional community and clinical sites
   - Develop closed-loop referral protocols with health systems, FQHCs, and community organizations
   - Train and deploy community health workers as navigators between healthcare and social services
   - Create bi-directional feedback systems (clinical → community and community → clinical)

2. **Domain 2 - Food and Nutrition Security**:
   - Implement universal food insecurity screening across partner sites
   - Establish referral pathways to Feeding South Florida, food pantries, SNAP enrollment
   - Develop produce prescription programs in partnership with FQHCs
   - Connect food security interventions to chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension)

**Population of Focus**:
- Low-income Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American residents of specific Miami-Dade neighborhoods
- High prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity
- Food insecurity rates above county average

**Differentiators**:
- AI-powered screening platform (FIU Thrive) enabling consistent, scalable assessment
- Existing CHW workforce and infrastructure
- Data-driven approach to measuring outcomes
- Academic-community-government partnership model

### Alternative Concept: Built Environment + Community-Clinical Linkages

**Concept Title**: "Creating Healthy, Connected Communities Through Transportation Access and Clinical Integration"

**Focus**: Address transportation barriers preventing access to healthcare and healthy food while strengthening clinical-community referral systems.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Leverage FIU Thrive as National Model**: Position Thrive as innovative, replicable approach that other communities can adapt
- **Academic-Practice Partnership**: FIU's research capacity + community implementation = evidence-based planning
- **Technology Integration**: AI-powered screening sets FIU apart from traditional SDOH approaches
- **Measurement Capacity**: Strong evaluation infrastructure to demonstrate impact and inform national practice

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Exceeding 6-page project narrative limit**: Content beyond 6 pages will NOT be reviewed - be ruthlessly concise

- **Non-profit organizations applying as lead**: Non-profits are NOT eligible as lead applicants, only as partners

- **Operating outside home jurisdiction**: Applications from organizations operating outside their jurisdiction will be deemed non-responsive

- **Missing CDC-funded program partnership**: Required letter of support from CDC-funded chronic disease program - start early

- **Including implementation costs in budget**: Budget scope is ONLY planning activities - implementation is out of scope

- **Using stipends/gift cards for community members**: Not allowable - must use contracts or consultant arrangements instead

- **Weak community engagement**: "Participatory" must mean shared decision-making, not just consultation

- **Selecting only one SDOH domain**: Minimum TWO domains required

- **Generic approach without community specificity**: Must identify specific community, population, and chronic disease disparities with data

- **Waiting until deadline to submit**: Technical issues are common - submit 2-3 days early

- **Not verifying SAM.gov registration is current**: Registration takes 7-10 days - don't discover expiration at deadline

- **Proposing duplicate services**: Must demonstrate coordination with CDC-funded programs to prevent duplication

- **Vague sustainability plan**: Required component of Accelerator Plan - must be specific even though implementation funding not guaranteed
