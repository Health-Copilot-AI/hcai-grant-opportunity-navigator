### Strategic Priorities

1. **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)**: Address upstream factors affecting chronic disease through policy, systems, environmental, and programmatic changes focused on five key domains: Community-Clinical Linkages, Food and Nutrition Security, Built Environment, Social Connectedness, and Tobacco-Free Policy.

2. **Health Equity**: Reduce chronic disease disparities in populations experiencing health inequities, with particular focus on racial and ethnic minority populations, rural communities, low-income populations, and underserved jurisdictions.

3. **Chronic Disease Prevention**: Prevent and manage leading causes of death and disability including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and tobacco-related diseases through evidence-based interventions.

4. **Community-Clinical Linkages**: Strengthen connections between healthcare systems, public health departments, and community organizations to improve population health outcomes and expand access to preventive services.

5. **Data-Driven Public Health**: Provide timely, high-quality health data and surveillance systems (PLACES, BRFSS, PRAMS) to help states and communities understand health measures and plan programs that meet population needs.

### Target Populations

- Populations experiencing chronic disease disparities and health inequities
- Racial and ethnic minority populations (African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
- Low-income and economically disadvantaged communities
- Rural and underserved populations
- U.S. territories and freely associated states
- Federally recognized and state-recognized tribal nations
- Geographic areas with high chronic disease burden and limited healthcare access

## Strategic Notes

1. **Planning Grant as Federal Entry Point**: SDOH Accelerator Plans represent low-risk, high-value federal funding entry point for FIU HWCOM. At ~$125,000 for 12-month planning period, resource requirements are modest while relationship-building value with CDC is substantial. Successful planning grant positions FIU for larger ACTion implementation grants ($500K/year) and establishes track record for other federal chronic disease prevention opportunities.

2. **FIU Thrive as National Differentiator**: CDC seeks innovative, replicable models for SDOH intervention. FIU Thrive's AI-powered screening platform, closed-loop referral system, and CHW navigation model represents exactly the type of scalable innovation CDC wants to disseminate nationally. Positioning Thrive as "what CDC-funded planning can achieve" rather than "what we want to plan" may strengthen application—demonstrate implementation readiness and use planning period to refine/document/package for replication.

3. **Community-Based Participatory Approach is Non-Negotiable**: CDC SDOH programs require genuine shared decision-making with community members, not token consultation. Leadership Team composition (minimum 2 community members, minimum 5 sector leaders) and participatory methods will be heavily scrutinized in review. FIU must invest time pre-NOFO to build authentic community partnerships and establish trust with populations experiencing chronic disease disparities. Letters of commitment from community members and partners will be evaluated for depth of engagement, not just presence.

4. **Bona Fide Agent or Government Partner Strategy Required**: Non-profit organizations and universities are NOT eligible as lead applicants. FIU has two pathways: (1) Establish formal bona fide agent relationship with Miami-Dade County or Florida DOH, requiring legal documentation and government authorization, OR (2) Support government entity application as lead with FIU as partner/subcontractor. Early legal review and government partner outreach essential. This structural requirement may be barrier but also ensures government buy-in and sustainability.

5. **Budget Uncertainty Requires Adaptive Strategy**: Proposed FY 2026 CDC budget restructuring creates uncertainty around NCCDPHP program continuity. While congressional response has favored maintaining funding levels, new SDOH Accelerator NOFO timing is unpredictable. FIU should: (1) Maintain active NOFO monitoring system, (2) Complete all pre-NOFO preparation activities (partner engagement, data compilation, concept development), (3) Position SDOH work for alternative funding streams (HRSA, SAMHSA, private foundations) if CDC program disrupted, and (4) Engage Florida congressional delegation to advocate for CDC chronic disease prevention funding.

6. **Miami-Dade Geographic Advantage**: Review of public awardee lists suggests Miami-Dade has not been recent SDOH Accelerator recipient. Combined with HHS Region 4 cap (maximum 3 state/local applicants per region), this may create competitive advantage if few other Florida jurisdictions apply. However, geographic distribution is only one factor—programmatic strength and community engagement quality remain primary determinants. Cannot rely on geography alone.

7. **Florida DOH Partnership is Critical Path Item**: Required letter of support from CDC-funded chronic disease prevention program (diabetes, cancer, heart disease/stroke, nutrition/physical activity/obesity) makes Florida Department of Health relationship essential, not optional. FIU should identify and engage relevant FL DOH program contacts immediately, understand state chronic disease prevention priorities, and ensure SDOH Accelerator Plan aligns with state strategies. This partnership also positions FIU for other state-administered CDC funding opportunities.

8. **Implementation Funding Path is Uncertain**: While ACTion grants ($1.5M over 3 years) theoretically follow successful planning grants, only 5 ACTion recipients were funded versus 71 total Accelerator Plan awardees. Planning grant should NOT be pursued solely as pathway to implementation funding. Instead, view planning period as opportunity to: (1) Build federal CDC relationship, (2) Document Thrive model rigor, (3) Strengthen multi-sector partnerships, (4) Create implementation-ready plan that can attract multiple funders (not just CDC), and (5) Generate preliminary data for larger R01-type research proposals.

9. **Route 1 (Thrive-Focused) is Natural Fit**: Within HCAI Grant Flow framework, SDOH Accelerator aligns perfectly with Route 1 (Thrive-Focused capability-driven opportunities). FIU Thrive is literally an SDOH intervention platform. Primary domain focus should be Community-Clinical Linkages (Thrive's core function) with secondary domain Food and Nutrition Security (NHELP's established strength). This natural alignment makes application development efficient and positions FIU to showcase existing capabilities rather than propose aspirational work.

10. **Pre-NOFO Preparation is Competitive Differentiator**: Federal grants with 60-90 day application windows favor applicants who have completed groundwork. FIU should use NOFO monitoring period to: compile Miami-Dade chronic disease and SDOH data, document Thrive platform capabilities and outcomes, form and convene Leadership Team, secure preliminary partner commitments, draft concept framework and domain selection rationale, identify community members with lived experience, establish FL DOH relationship, and prepare budget templates. When NOFO releases, prepared applicants submit stronger applications while competitors scramble to meet eligibility requirements.
