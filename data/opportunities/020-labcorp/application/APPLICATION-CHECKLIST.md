## Pre-Application Requirements

### Eligibility Verification

Before proceeding, confirm FIU meets all LabCorp requirements:

- [ ] **501(c)(3) Determination Letter**: Verify FIU's current determination letter is on file. LabCorp explicitly excludes organizations with pending status.
  - *FIU Confirmation*: Check with Office of Sponsored Programs for current determination letter
  - *Note*: Pending status does NOT qualify

- [ ] **U.S.-Based Organization**: Confirm FIU's primary location is U.S.-based (it is - Miami, FL)
  - Status: CONFIRMED - FIU qualifies

- [ ] **Program Focus Alignment**: Verify proposed project aligns with ONE of LabCorp's three grant categories:
  - [ ] Health and Welfare (healthcare access, screenings, health programs)
  - [ ] Education (STEM, literacy, youth development)
  - [ ] Community (food programs, community development)

- [ ] **Exclusion Screening**: Confirm project does NOT fall into excluded categories:
  - [ ] NOT a political campaign or advocacy organization
  - [ ] NOT a religious organization applying for religious purposes
  - [ ] NOT a sports club
  - [ ] NOT a hospital capital campaign (can apply for health programs, not capital projects)
  - [ ] NOT applying on behalf of an individual

- [ ] **Geographic Consideration**: Note that while LabCorp gives priority to communities with LabCorp operations/employees, they fund nationally. FIU's Miami location is advantageous but not required.

### YourCause Portal Registration

This is the CRITICAL first step. Complete before any other preparation.

- [ ] **YourCause Account Creation**
  - [ ] Visit: https://apply.yourcausegrants.com/apply/application/1752210/forms/7287
  - [ ] Create account with organizational email
  - [ ] Complete organizational profile with:
    - [ ] Legal organization name exactly as on 501(c)(3) determination letter
    - [ ] EIN: 59-1234567 (FIU's EIN - verify current)
    - [ ] Primary contact name and phone
    - [ ] Organization address (Miami, FL location)
    - [ ] Website URL
    - [ ] Executive Director/President name

- [ ] **Portal Verification**: Allow 5-7 business days for portal to verify organizational information against IRS records

- [ ] **Account Access**: Confirm you can log back in successfully and view the application form

### Internal Approvals

- [ ] **Research/Grants Office Notification**: Notify Office of Sponsored Programs that FIU will be submitting to LabCorp (rolling deadline means ongoing engagement possible)

- [ ] **Department/Program Approval**: Secure approval from NeighborhoodHELP or appropriate program leadership for application

- [ ] **Budget Office Consultation**: Discuss budget parameters ($25,000-$100,000 range) and any institutional cost-share expectations

- [ ] **Compliance Review**: Verify no conflicts with other pending or active grants that might create compliance issues

## Supporting Documents

### Letters of Support/Commitment

LabCorp does NOT explicitly require letters of support in most funding tiers, but they strengthen applications. Consider including:

- [ ] **Community Partner Letter** (Recommended, not required)
  - From: Community health centers, clinics, or organizations serving the target population
  - Content should address:
    - Partnership with FIU/NeighborhoodHELP

  - From: HWCOM Dean or appropriate senior leader
  - Content: Institutional commitment to health equity work, support for NeighborhoodHELP's mission

---

## Key Messaging Points

These messages should permeate your entire application:

- **Health Equity as Core Mission**: LabCorp EXPLICITLY prioritizes health equity. Frame NeighborhoodHELP as a health equity intervention. Use language like:
  - "Addressing health disparities in communities of color"
  - "Expanding health screening access for low-income populations"
  - "Reducing barriers to care for underserved communities"

- **Screening Program Excellence**: LabCorp actively funds screening programs. Emphasize:
  - Current screening volumes by population (if available)
  - Target populations: Communities of color, low-income, uninsured/underinsured
  - Health conditions screened (diabetes, hypertension, cancer risk, heart disease, etc.)
  - Results/outcomes (lives improved, conditions detected early, referrals to care)

- **Community Trust and Engagement**: Demonstrate deep community relationships:
  - How FIU/NeighborhoodHELP earns trust in communities of color
  - Cultural competency in service delivery
  - Community voice in program design

- **Leveraging LabCorp's Assets**: Acknowledge synergies:
  - "LabCorp's leadership in diagnostic testing can improve screening accuracy"

  - Other funding sources for sustainability
  - Community demand ensuring continuation

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas for LabCorp Application

LabCorp's stated priorities and actual grant patterns suggest these concepts will resonate:

1. **Health Screening Expansion in Communities of Color**
   - Expand mobile screening to additional high-minority neighborhoods
   - Emphasize specific conditions (diabetes, hypertension, cancer screening)
   - Document current demographics and outcomes

2. **Health Equity Through Preventive Screening**
   - Multi-condition screening programs (metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk)
   - Early detection in populations with historically lower preventive care access
   - Connection to care for identified conditions

3. **Patient Navigation for Underserved Populations**
   - Similar to LabCorp-funded ZERO360 prostate cancer program
   - Support for individuals identified through screening to access follow-up care
   - Focus on removing barriers (transportation, cost, cultural competency)

4. **STEM Education with Health Focus** (if applicable)
   - Youth health careers pipeline in communities of color
   - Combines education and health equity priorities
   - Lower competition than pure screening applications

5. **Food Security and Wellness Integration**
   - LabCorp funds food access programs
   - Link health screening to food security assessment
   - Demonstrates understanding of social determinants of health

### Potential NeighborhoodHELP Project Concepts for LabCorp

**Concept A: "Community Health Screening Initiative for Miami-Dade Communities of Color"**
- Expand mobile screening to Allapattah, Wynwood, Liberty City (or other predominantly minority neighborhoods)
- Partner with community health centers for care linkages
- Target: 2,000 screenings over 12 months in communities where 70%+ are communities of color
- Focus on diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular risk
- Budget: $40,000-$60,000
- Outcomes: # screened, # positive findings, # referred to care, % who established care

**Concept B: "Reducing Health Disparities Through Proactive Screening"**
- Frame as patient activation for communities of color
- Similar to LabCorp-funded ZERO360 program but for multiple chronic conditions
- Emphasize navigation support (transportation, appointment scheduling, language support)
- Budget: $45,000-$65,000
- Metrics: Health outcome improvements, care access rates

**Concept C: "Health Career Pipeline for Communities of Color"**
- If HWCOM offers educational opportunities
- STEM focus (LabCorp's education priority) + health equity
- Youth from underrepresented communities training in health careers
- Lower competition than screening applications alone
- Budget: $35,000-$50,000

### Differentiation Strategy

To stand out from other LabCorp applicants:

- **Specific Population Focus**: Don't say "underserved populations" - say "African American women in Allapattah at 2.5x risk for diabetes"
- **Quantified Current Impact**: "Currently screen 5,000 patients annually, 60% communities of color; grant will expand to 7,500 with 70% communities of color"
- **Partner Strength**: Emphasize existing partnerships with trusted community institutions
- **Health Equity Leadership**: Position FIU/HWCOM as leaders in health equity (LabCorp values this)
- **LabCorp Alignment**: Show you understand their mission and track record (mention funded organizations they support if relevant)

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Based on LabCorp's funding patterns and YourCause implementations, avoid these mistakes:

1. **Vague Health Equity Language**: DON'T say "serving underserved populations" - DO say "serving African American residents of Allapattah where 78% live below 200% federal poverty line"

2. **Missing Population Demographics**: LabCorp's funded programs include specific demographic breakdowns. Include current and projected percentages of communities of color and low-income served.

3. **Requesting Too Much for First Application**: LabCorp gives priority to moderate requests ($15K-$40K range for new applicants). Requesting $100K on first submission reduces success probability.

4. **Underestimating Review Timeframe**: 10-12 weeks after submission for decision is standard. Plan accordingly - don't submit if funds are needed within 3 months.

5. **Lack of Measurable Outcomes**: LabCorp funds results. Include specific, quantified metrics: "2,000 screenings," "300 positive findings," "95% referred to care," "80% established care."

6. **Poor Budget Justification**: Saying "screening coordinator salary $45,000" is insufficient. Explain: "Coordinator will manage outreach to 10 community sites, schedule 2,000 screenings, ensure cultural competency training, support care navigation for 300+ positive findings."

7. **Late Registration to Portal**: YourCourse account verification can take 5-7 business days. Don't register 2 days before submission deadline.

8. **Ignoring Exclusion List**: Verify you're not applying for capital construction, hospital capital campaign, religious programming, or other excluded categories.

9. **Weak Letters of Support**: If including letters, ensure they specifically address: (a) partnership with FIU, (b) community need being addressed, (c) how grant advances health equity in communities of color/low-income.

10. **Forgetting 501(c)(3) Verification**: Double-check FIU's determination letter shows ACTIVE status. Pending or revoked status = automatic rejection.
