- Program-related investments vs. traditional grants
- Timing differences between cash disbursement and grant commitment

2. **Grants Paid Reporting**: Instrumentl shows $0 grants in 2023, which contradicts press releases. Schedule I from full 990 would provide definitive data.

3. **Compensation Structure**: "Related compensation" figures suggest complex compensation arrangements across related organizations.

4. **Schedule I Access**: Complete grantee lists require downloading full 990 PDF from ProPublica or GuideStar.
