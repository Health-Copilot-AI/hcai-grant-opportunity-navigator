## Charity Navigator Analysis

### Overall Rating

**1-Star Rating (56 out of 100)** - Accountability & Finance Beacon Only

### Metric Details

| Metric | Score | Max Points | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| Independent Board Members | 8 | 8 | 100% independent |
| Board Size | 7 | 7 | 13+ members |
| Audit/Oversight Committee | 15 | 15 | In place |
| No Material Diversion | 10 | 10 | Clean record |
| Liabilities to Assets Ratio | 0 | 15 | 6.70% ratio |
| Program Expense Ratio | 0 | 25 | 24.41% |
| Form 990 Availability | 0 | 4 | Not on website |

### Rating Interpretation

**Important Context:** The low Charity Navigator rating does NOT indicate poor performance. The foundation's low "program expense ratio" reflects its operating model as a grantmaker:

1. **Grantmaking foundations** distribute funds to partner organizations who deliver services
2. **Operating charities** spend funds directly on program delivery
3. Standard charity metrics are designed for operating charities, not grantmakers

The foundation has strong governance indicators:
- 100% independent board
- Proper oversight committees
- No asset diversion issues
- Documented policies
