## Access to Care Page

### Program Goal
The Health Foundation of South Florida aims to "increase access to routine and preventive medical care for children and adults" to strengthen healthcare availability in underserved communities.

### Background Context

**High Uninsured Rates:** South Florida has uninsured rates exceeding national averages. Counties documented include Broward (15%), Miami-Dade (16.7%), and Monroe (18.7%), with disparities particularly affecting low-income, Black, and Hispanic residents.

**Care Access Challenges:** Many residents lack "a usual source of care," leading to reliance on emergency rooms—the most expensive care setting.

### Strategic Focus Areas

The foundation pursues multiple approaches:
- Expanding health insurance coverage
- Adopting alternative care delivery models
- Growing safety net clinic capacity
- Supporting healthcare access policy advocacy

### Funding Priorities

The foundation supports initiatives addressing:

1. **Enrollment and Outreach:** Innovative collaborations and sustainable, scalable enrollment models at local and system levels

2. **Digital Health:** Technology-driven solutions increasing patient engagement and health outcomes

3. **Alternative Access Points:** Nurse-managed centers and telehealth expansion with appropriate reimbursement advocacy

4. **Safety Net Expansion:** Infrastructure support addressing operational and technical barriers

5. **Policy Advocacy:** Advancing state and regional solutions for healthcare access and utilization

### Project Examples

Supported initiatives include work by Health Council of South Florida, Broward Regional Health Planning Council, Hispanic Unity's Te Ayudo Program, and Monroe County Access to Care Collaborative.

## Health Systems & Social Needs Page

### Mission
The Health Foundation of South Florida seeks to "advance a collaborative system, across sectors, that enables and facilitates the integration of social needs and health care" to reduce health disparities.

### Key Findings on Social Drivers of Health

**Prevalence:** A 2022 Physicians Foundation survey found that "95% of doctors surveyed indicated that some, many, or all of their patients had at least one social driver affecting health outcomes." Financial instability and transportation ranked as top concerns, followed by housing, food insecurity, and safety issues.

**Health Impact:** Unmet social needs correlate with:
- Nearly double the depression rate
- 60% higher diabetes prevalence
- Over 50% higher cholesterol and elevated hemoglobin A1c levels
- More than double emergency department visits
- More than double clinic no-show rates

### Strategic Approach

The foundation pursues four key initiatives:

1. **Business Case Development** — Demonstrating ROI for healthcare organizations investing in social needs interventions

2. **Enabling Infrastructure** — Creating conditions for implementing promising interventions like medical-legal partnerships and food pharmacies

3. **Technology Platforms** — Supporting referral systems connecting health and social services sectors

4. **Payment Reform** — Advocating for financing mechanisms that support social needs interventions

## Thriving Community / Healthy Community Page

### Overview
The Health Foundation targets social and economic conditions affecting physical, mental, and emotional well-being by fostering awareness of community development's intersection with health, emphasizing housing and economic prosperity.

### Core Concept: Social Determinants of Health
Access to stable housing, nutritious food, employment, education, and safe streets fundamentally predict individual and community health outcomes.

### Regional Challenges
South Florida faces severe affordability and inequality issues. "47.6% percent of Miami-Dade's and 42.2% percent of Broward's households" spend over 30% of monthly income on housing alone.

Post-COVID disparities have intensified across multiple dimensions:
- **Economic Inequality**: Job losses concentrated in tourism, hospitality, and retail sectors
- **Housing Crisis**: Rising costs limiting low-income access
- **Education Gaps**: Remote learning exposed technology and resource barriers
- **Healthcare Disparities**: Minority communities experienced disproportionate pandemic impacts

### Strategic Focus Areas

#### Affordable Housing
The Foundation describes housing as "the first vaccine" and supports projects that:
- Increase understanding of housing-health connections
- Strengthen community advocacy capacity for housing policy
- Pilot integrated health and housing models with supportive services
- Fund policy initiatives protecting affordable housing resources

#### Economic Development & Anchor Institutions
Through the South Florida Anchor Alliance, the Foundation funds initiatives promoting:
- Regional institutional alignment toward inclusive local economies
- Community wealth-building investments
- Workforce pipeline programs targeting unemployed or underemployed populations

## South Florida Anchor Alliance Page

### Origin & Purpose
The South Florida Anchor Alliance emerged from a December 2017 convening organized by the Health Foundation of South Florida, Citi Community Development, and the Federal Reserve of Atlanta.

### Core Focus Areas

**Supplier Diversity:** The alliance created the South Florida Regional Marketplace to connect local small and minority-owned businesses with anchor institution contracts and opportunities.

**Workforce Development:** The group addresses nursing and allied health workforce shortages through student success initiatives designed to "enhance retention and completion rates of students."

### Key Accomplishments

- Established workgroups across Miami-Dade and Broward counties by early 2019
- Adopted a Blueprint for Action in 2020 outlining transformational economic strategies
- Launched systems addressing supplier diversity and workforce pipeline development
