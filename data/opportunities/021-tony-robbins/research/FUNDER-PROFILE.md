## FIU/NHELP/Thrive Alignment Assessment

### Alignment Strengths

| Factor | Alignment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Underserved Populations** | HIGH | NHELP serves exact target populations |
| **Youth Focus** | MODERATE | Thrive reaches families with children |
| **Empowerment Model** | HIGH | Thrive's self-efficacy approach aligns |
| **Health/Human Services** | HIGH | Community health services match |
| **Geographic** | MODERATE | Florida is priority state |

### Potential Fit Areas

1. **FIU Thrive + Youth Leadership** - Develop youth empowerment component within Thrive platform
2. **NHELP + Hunger Relief** - Food security screening and referral integration
3. **Community Health Workers** - Empowerment model for underserved communities
4. **Social Determinants** - Addressing housing, food, economic needs

### Considerations

- Grant size (up to $15,000 typical) may be pilot-appropriate
- Strong alignment with empowerment/self-efficacy philosophy
- Florida is within geographic priority area
- May need to frame as discrete pilot project rather than operational support

---

## Strategic Notes

1. **Empowerment Philosophy Match:** Foundation's focus on empowerment and self-sufficiency aligns with FIU Thrive's behavior change approach
2. **Pilot Scale:** $15K typical grants appropriate for pilot programs or specific components
3. **Rolling Deadline:** Flexibility in timing; can submit when ready
4. **LOI First:** No full application unless invited - reduces wasted effort
5. **Larger Grants Possible:** Strategic initiatives like Marici ($501K) and Sharing Excess ($300K) show capacity for larger awards
6. **Zero Overhead Leadership:** All compensation goes to programs, not executives
