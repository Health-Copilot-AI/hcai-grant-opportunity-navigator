---

## Key Messaging Points

- **Funder Priority Alignment**: Frame project as empowering underserved communities to overcome barriers (poverty, health disparities, food insecurity, housing). Use foundation's language: "helping people often forgotten" achieve self-sufficiency and sustainable change.

- **Empowerment Philosophy Match**: Emphasize how project builds community agency and self-efficacy, not just service delivery. Highlight how beneficiaries are agents of change in their own lives.

- **Sustainability Beyond Funding**: Clearly articulate how project impacts continue after grant period. Foundation philosophy of "genuine fulfillment through contribution" suggests they value lasting change, not one-time interventions.

- **Global/Local Impact**: While foundation has global focus, Florida is priority state. Emphasize how local Miami-Dade work could be model for other underserved communities nationally or internationally.

- **Youth/Intergenerational Benefit**: If applicable, highlight youth component or intergenerational impact. Foundation heavily invests in youth leadership development.

- **Measurable Impact**: Provide specific, quantifiable outcomes. Foundation tracks scale: "525M meals" and "1,700+ prisons served" suggest they value demonstrable scope of impact.

- **Track Record**: If FIU/NHELP has prior success with similar populations, emphasize proven ability to reach and serve underserved communities effectively.

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas for FIU

1. **Community Health Worker Empowerment**: Mobile health services (NHELP model) that build self-efficacy and health literacy in underserved Miami-Dade communities, connecting residents to resources for food security, housing, and economic support.

2. **Youth Health Leadership Pipeline**: Develop youth (14-25) from underserved communities as peer health educators and community health workers, combining empowerment training with practical healthcare skills.

3. **Food Security Screening and Referral Integration**: Enhance NHELP mobile clinics to screen for food insecurity and connect residents with nutrition resources and Feeding America partnerships (foundation has strong food security focus).

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Community-Led Approach**: Frame NHELP as genuinely community-driven, where residents identify priorities and drive implementation
- **Measurable Empowerment**: Quantify not just health outcomes but also increases in self-efficacy, community participation, and resident leadership
- **Scalable Model**: Position FIU pilot as replicable approach other universities/health systems could adopt in their underserved communities
- **Partnership with Feeding America**: Align with foundation's major food security partnership to magnify impact
- **Sustainability Path**: Demonstrate how empowered communities become advocates for sustained funding/resources beyond grant period

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Exceeding 3-page LOI limit** - Foundation strictly enforces 3-page maximum; pages beyond this will not be reviewed. Prioritize conciseness over comprehensiveness.

- **Unclear connection to empowerment philosophy** - Don't just describe services; explicitly explain how project empowers beneficiaries to address their own challenges and achieve self-sufficiency.

- **Vague or unmeasurable outcomes** - Avoid general statements like "improve lives." Include specific, quantifiable metrics (e.g., "80% of participants will demonstrate increased health literacy" rather than "participants will be healthier").

- **Missing needs assessment** - Foundation wants to understand what problem exists before your solution. Include data on the population and specific needs being addressed.

- **Generic mission alignment statement** - "Our mission aligns with your mission" is insufficient. Provide specific examples of how work matches foundation's priorities for underserved populations.

- **Forgetting sustainability plan** - Foundation philosophy emphasizes lasting change. Include clear explanation of how impact and/or services continue after grant funding ends.

- **Insufficient budget detail** - Even LOI budget overview needs justification. Show foundation you've thought through costs realistically and can steward resources effectively.

- **Missing Tax ID or organizational details** - Include EIN and full organizational name as they appear on nonprofit registration.

- **Weak community voice** - Avoid top-down "we will help them" framing. Demonstrate that underserved communities are partners/leaders in project design and implementation.
