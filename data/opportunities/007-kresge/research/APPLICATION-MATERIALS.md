## FIU HWCOM Strategic Approach

1. **Prior Relationship:** Catalyst Miami partnership provides credibility
2. **CCHE Alignment:** Catalyst Miami is current CCHE grantee
3. **Climate Vulnerability:** Miami is highly climate-vulnerable
4. **Health Equity Focus:** Core to both organizations

### Recommended Outreach Template

```
Subject: FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine - Interest in CCHE Initiative

Dear [Kresge Health Program Staff],

Building on FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine's prior partnership
with Kresge through Catalyst Miami, we are writing to share developments
in our NeighborhoodHELP mobile health program and express interest in
the Climate Change, Health & Equity initiative.

Miami-Dade County faces significant climate health vulnerabilities, and
NeighborhoodHELP has established trusted community infrastructure to
deliver health interventions to affected populations. Our new FIU Thrive
AI-powered screening platform enhances our capacity to identify and
address climate-related social determinants of health.

Key points:
- 15+ years serving underserved Miami-Dade communities
- Mobile health infrastructure reaching climate-vulnerable populations
- Prior experience with climate/health integration (Americares partnership)
- Health equity lens central to all programming
- Community partnerships including [specific organizations]

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss how our community health
infrastructure might contribute to Kresge's CCHE goals in South Florida.

Best regards,
[Signature]
```
