## Health Program

**Source:** https://kresge.org/our-work/health/

### Mission
The Health Program builds "equity-focused systems of health that create opportunities for all people to achieve well-being." The program recognizes that health extends beyond healthcare to encompass housing, education, income, transportation, community participation, and interactions with institutional systems.

### Core Philosophy
The foundation acknowledges that "access to these social determinants of health is governed by unfair systems and structures that perpetuate racism, sexism, discrimination against immigrants, discrimination against people with disabilities, and poverty."

### Three Strategic Focus Areas

**1. Community-Driven Solutions**
Partners with communities to create locally determined solutions that influence systems, services, and practices.

**2. Community Investment for Health Equity**
Aims to improve health equity through community investment systems designed to close racial wealth gaps.

**3. Community Health Ecosystems**
Supports local health ecosystems enabling people and communities to achieve health and well-being.

### Key Initiatives
- **Climate Change, Health & Equity (CCHE)** - Mobilizes equitable climate action from healthcare institutions and community advocates
- **PHEARLESS** - Develops regenerative leaders advancing health equity and well-being

### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals are assessed based on:
- Community priority representation
- Community leadership development
- Cross-sector partnerships
- Population health promotion
- Effective communications strategies
- Explicit equity lens application

### Program Team
Led by Monica Valdes Lupi (Managing Director), with support from program officers, fellows, and administrative staff.

### Overview

### Program Structure and Funding
PHEARLESS brings rising public health leaders together with community leaders to co-create sustainable solutions that advance health equity and well-being for all.

- Each of the 15 teams selected includes two community leaders as well as two public health officials
- Through the 12-month PHEARLESS experience, comprising four learning modules and a culminating capstone activity, participants develop the mindset and skills to transform systems, structures and policies, in partnership with community, toward a just and equitable future
- Each four-person team receives a $100,000 grant to support their activities
- In addition to the $100,000 grant, teams also receive $9,000 stipends for each of the two community leaders

### Approach: Regenerative Leadership
As a holistic, strengths-based, and adaptive approach to leadership, regenerative leadership focuses on creating positive change and restoring balance in complex living systems. By creating positive relationships and nurturing the interconnected elements within a system, regenerative leaders aim to generate outcomes that benefit everyone.

### Program Partners
- **National Program Office:** University of South Florida
- Co-designed and implemented by faculty at the USF College of Public Health and the USF Muma College of Business
- ASTHO, the Big Cities Health Coalition, and NACCHO are members of the PHEARLESS initiative's interdisciplinary support network
