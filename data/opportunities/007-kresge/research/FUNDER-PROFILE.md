## Strategic Notes

1. **Invitation-Only Barrier Requires Relationship Strategy**: Kresge does not accept unsolicited proposals, making relationship building through Catalyst Miami connection essential. Direct outreach to Monica Valdes Lupi (Health Program Managing Director) should reference prior partnership and express interest in CCHE work.

2. **CCHE Initiative Represents Prime Opportunity**: With $48.6 million invested across two phases and Catalyst Miami as current grantee, the Climate Change, Health & Equity initiative is the strongest entry point. Miami's climate vulnerability + NeighborhoodHELP's community infrastructure + FIU Thrive's SDOH screening creates compelling narrative.

3. **Systems Change Over Direct Service**: Kresge explicitly seeks population-level, systems-change approaches rather than direct service expansion. Frame NeighborhoodHELP as delivery infrastructure for climate-health interventions that influence local policy and service systems, not just individual patient care.

4. **Community Power-Building Essential**: All proposals must demonstrate how they build community leadership and decision-making power. Partner with community organizations (e.g., Catalyst Miami) to show co-creation model; avoid positioning FIU as sole leader.

5. **Equity Must Be Explicit and Central**: Generic mentions of "serving vulnerable populations" will not meet Kresge standards. Require specific analysis of racial equity, structural barriers, and how interventions address root causes of inequity (housing, income, climate vulnerability).

6. **Cross-Sector Partnerships Required**: Single-sector health proposals unlikely to succeed. Connect NeighborhoodHELP to housing providers, climate resilience organizations, food security programs, transportation access initiatives to demonstrate multi-stakeholder approach.

7. **Multi-Year Relationship Development**: Given invitation-only process and Kresge's preference for sustained partnerships, plan 6-12 month relationship-building timeline before expecting funding opportunity. Use this time to participate in CCHE convenings, connect through Catalyst Miami, and build credibility.

8. **Strategic Communications Important**: Kresge values "effective communications strategies" as evaluation criterion. Develop clear messaging about how FIU's work contributes to narrative change around climate, health, and equity - not just service delivery metrics.

## Strategic Alignment for FIU HWCOM

### Alignment Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Mission Match** | ★★★★★ Strong | Health equity, systems change, community-driven approaches align perfectly |
| **Geographic Fit** | ★★★☆☆ Moderate | Miami not a priority city, but climate vulnerability makes it relevant for CCHE |
| **Program Fit** | ★★★★★ Strong | CCHE initiative directly relevant; health ecosystem focus matches NHELP model |
| **Prior Relationship** | ★★★☆☆ Moderate | Indirect through Catalyst Miami; provides credible entry point |
| **Access Pathway** | ★★☆☆☆ Challenging | Invitation-only requires 6-12 month relationship building |
| **Award Size** | ★★★★★ Strong | $100K-$500K typical range matches FIU capacity and need |

### Recommended Positioning

**Primary Frame**: Position NeighborhoodHELP as community delivery infrastructure for climate-health interventions in Miami-Dade, leveraging FIU Thrive AI platform for population-level SDOH data that enables systems-change policy recommendations.

**Key Talking Points**:
1. **Climate Vulnerability**: Miami-Dade faces extreme heat, flooding, hurricanes - all with disproportionate health impacts on low-income communities
2. **Catalyst Miami Partnership**: Build on existing CCHE grantee relationship to co-create climate-health solutions
3. **Community Infrastructure**: NeighborhoodHELP's 10+ years of trusted presence in vulnerable neighborhoods provides established delivery mechanism
4. **Systems-Level Data**: FIU Thrive aggregates SDOH data across populations to inform policy and systems interventions, not just individual care
5. **Cross-Sector Partnerships**: Connect to housing (climate-resilient affordable housing), transportation (cooling centers access), food (climate impacts on food security)

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1: Relationship Reactivation (Months 1-3)**
1. Research Catalyst Miami partnership details and outcomes
2. Identify FIU HWCOM contacts from prior Catalyst Miami work
3. Prepare update on NeighborhoodHELP/Thrive progress since partnership

**Phase 2: Strategic Outreach (Months 3-6)**
1. Contact Monica Valdes Lupi (Health Program Managing Director)
2. Reference Catalyst Miami partnership in outreach
3. Request informational conversation about CCHE initiative opportunities in Miami
4. Attend CCHE convenings or webinars if available

**Phase 3: Co-Creation Exploration (Months 6-12)**
1. Propose partnership with Catalyst Miami on climate-health project
2. Position NHELP as community delivery mechanism for climate interventions
3. Connect FIU Thrive data capabilities to community-identified priorities
4. Explore invitation to submit proposal or participate in future RFP
