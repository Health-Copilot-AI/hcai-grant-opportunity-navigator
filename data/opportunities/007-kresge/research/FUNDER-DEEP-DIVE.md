## Strategic Alignment for FIU HWCOM

### Alignment Factors

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Mission Match** | Strong - Health equity, systems change, community-driven |
| **Geographic Fit** | Moderate - Miami not priority city, but climate-vulnerable |
| **Program Fit** | Strong - CCHE initiative directly relevant |
| **Prior Relationship** | YES - Catalyst Miami partnership ($200K) |
| **Access Pathway** | Challenging - Invitation-only requires relationship building |

### Priority Opportunity: CCHE Initiative

**Why CCHE Fits:**

2. Catalyst Miami is current CCHE grantee (potential connector)
3. NHELP has climate/health experience (Americares work)
4. Health equity lens is core to both organizations
5. Community-driven model aligns with Kresge values

### Recommended Approach

**Strategy:** Build relationship through Catalyst Miami connection and express interest in CCHE work for South Florida.

**Key Talking Points:**
- Reference Catalyst Miami partnership history
- Emphasize Miami's climate vulnerability
- Position NHELP as community delivery infrastructure
- Highlight health equity and SDOH integration
- Connect to FIU Thrive AI-enhanced screening
