  - "Our emerging Thrive AI platform is positioned to transform how mobile health programs track and demonstrate outcomes—this grant accelerates that capability."

- **Track Record & Sustainability**:
  - "15 years of continuous mobile healthcare operations demonstrates institutional commitment and financial sustainability."
  - "NHELP is integrated into FIU's medical school curriculum and state-funded operations—permanent infrastructure ensures long-term sustainability."

- **Community Engagement**:
  - "NHELP serves 5,000+ patients annually in underserved Miami-Dade neighborhoods with 85%+ Spanish speakers and limited insurance access."
  - "Our medical students and faculty physicians bring academic rigor to community health—evaluation enhancement will document these outcomes for the field."

- **Innovation & Distinctiveness**:
  - "Proposed evaluation will formalize social determinants of health (SDOH) tracking and document medical student educational outcomes—areas of critical interest to healthcare funders and medical educators."
  - "Thrive platform integration represents frontier work in AI-assisted evaluation for mobile health—results will benefit entire MHA membership."

- **Sustainability Path**:
  - "Evaluation systems implemented with grant funding will become permanent FIU infrastructure—systems will continue indefinitely post-grant."
  - "Training provided to NHELP staff creates lasting capacity—skills transfer internally and remain with program."

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

These align best with MHA funding priorities and NHELP capabilities:

1. **Evaluation System Enhancement**
   - MHA core focus: builds evaluation/monitoring capacity
   - NHELP fit: Currently collect data informally; formalize systems
   - Advantage: Clear connection to funder priorities

2. **Outcomes Measurement & Data Infrastructure**
   - MHA priority: help members demonstrate impact
   - NHELP fit: Position Thrive platform as evaluation backbone
   - Advantage: Showcases innovation, benefits membership

3. **Safety & Security Protocols**
   - MHA recent trend: 2023 cycle funded safety initiatives
   - NHELP consideration: Urban setting has security/safety elements
   - Advantage: Responsive to recent funder interests

### Potential Project Concepts

**Concept 1: Thrive AI Platform Integration for Outcomes Measurement**
- *Project description*: Implement Thrive AI platform as formalized evaluation system for NHELP patient outcomes
- *Use of funds*: Software integration ($2-3K), staff training ($2K), outcome metrics design ($2K), pilot data collection ($2-3K)
- *Timeline*: 6-month implementation with 3-month data collection
- *Impact*: NHELP becomes model for AI-assisted evaluation in mobile health
- *Sustainability*: Platform becomes permanent FIU infrastructure

**Concept 2: Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Measurement System**
- *Project description*: Develop systematic SDOH screening and outcome tracking for NHELP patients
- *Use of funds*: SDOH assessment tool selection/development ($1-2K), staff training ($1.5K), data system setup ($2.5K), analysis/reporting ($2-3K)
- *Timeline*: Tool selection/training (Month 1-2), pilot screening (Month 3-4), analysis (Month 5-6)
- *Impact*: Quantify NHELP's SDOH impact; support policy/funding narratives
- *Sustainability*: Screening becomes routine practice; reporting informs quality improvement

**Concept 3: Medical Student Educational Outcomes Assessment**
- *Project description*: Formalize evaluation of medical student learning outcomes from NHELP clinical rotations
- *Use of funds*: Assessment instrument development ($1.5K), data collection/management ($2K), faculty training ($1.5K), analysis/reporting ($2.5K)
- *Timeline*: Instrument design (Month 1-2), semester data collection (Month 2-5), analysis and report (Month 6)
- *Impact*: Document unique IPE/community medicine contributions; supports ACCME/ACGME reporting
- *Sustainability*: Assessment becomes part of curriculum documentation

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Stand out from peer applications**:
  - NHELP's 15-year track record is substantially longer than many mobile programs
  - Integration of academic medical education is relatively unique
  - FIU institutional support ensures sustainability (major differentiator)
  - Thrive platform innovation positions NHELP as field leader

- **Unique assets to emphasize**:
  - University-based model with research capacity
  - Embedded medical student education (dual value: healthcare + education)
  - AI platform development capability (most programs lack technical innovation capacity)
  - State institution permanence (no closure risk unlike smaller nonprofits)

- **Gap in funder's portfolio**:
  - MHA members typically small/mid-size nonprofits; FIU is larger institution
  - NHELP's medical education component is rare among mobile health programs
  - Thrive platform represents technology frontier most members cannot access
  - Positioning NHELP as innovation partner for membership benefits funder

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Not maintaining membership**: Application disqualified if membership lapses before deadline
  - *Mitigation*: Join early (summer 2026); set renewal reminder

- **Weak evaluation plan**: MHA wants specific, achievable evaluation improvements
  - *Avoid*: Vague goals like "improve data collection"
  - *Instead*: Specific systems (e.g., "implement SDOH screening tool X" or "deploy Thrive analytics dashboard")

- **Undersized budget**: Proposing less than $10,000 (ask for less than available)
  - *Avoid*: "We'll do this for $5,000"
  - *Instead*: Use full $10,000—budget activities fully and realistically

- **Unrealistic timeline**: Planning implementation in less than 6 months
  - *Avoid*: Proposing staff training, tool acquisition, AND complete data analysis in 3 months
  - *Instead*: Realistic 6-month phased implementation (setup, implementation, analysis)

- **Lack of sustainability plan**: Not explaining how systems continue after grant ends
  - *Avoid*: Grant funds one-time expense with no follow-up
  - *Instead*: Explain how evaluation becomes permanent NHELP practice

- **Weak organizational narrative**: Funder doesn't understand NHELP's significance
  - *Avoid*: Assuming MHA knows about program; give context
  - *Instead*: Paint clear picture of 15-year mobile health operation, underserved populations served, institutional support

- **Missing internal sign-offs**: Submitting without dean/director approval
  - *Avoid*: Last-minute approvals
  - *Instead*: Get buy-in early; involve leadership in planning

- **Poor connection to MHA priorities**: Proposing evaluation work disconnected from mobile health mission
  - *Avoid*: Research project unrelated to operations
  - *Instead*: Frame evaluation as operational strengthening (evaluation IS operational capacity-building)

## Notes & Strategy

### 2026 Cycle Preparation Strategy

The 2025 cycle deadline has passed. Use the 2026 preparation year strategically:

1. **Network**: Attend 2025 conference (Sept 13-16, Louisville) to build relationships with MHA staff and recent grantees
2. **Learn**: Ask 2023-2024 grantees about their projects and what worked in their applications
3. **Innovate**: Finalize Thrive platform development; use as competitive advantage in proposal
4. **Document**: Compile NHELP operational data and impact metrics
5. **Position**: Establish FIU as university-based innovation leader in mobile health
6. **Member Early**: Join MHA in spring 2026 to establish member status well before deadline

### Why NHELP is Perfect Fit

- **Funder priority**: Mobile health operations → NHELP IS mobile health
- **Eligibility**: 15+ years operational → Exceeds 1-year requirement substantially
- **Institutional support**: State-funded FIU program → Permanent infrastructure, no closure risk
- **Innovation angle**: Thrive AI platform + medical education + community health = unique model
- **Scale**: $10,000 fits NHELP evaluation enhancement (not capital construction, equipment)
- **Sustainability**: FIU ensures indefinite continuation post-grant

**Recommendation**: Prioritize this opportunity for 2026 cycle. Strong alignment warrants dedicated attention.
