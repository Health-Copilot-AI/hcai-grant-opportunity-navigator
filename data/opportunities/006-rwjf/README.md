## Research Concept

### Evidence for Action Focus Areas

1. **Structural Racism** - How racist policies affect health
2. **Indigenous Health** - Sovereignty and self-determination
3. **Policy Solutions** - Evidence for structural interventions
4. **Community Power** - Building community agency

### Proposed Study Approach

**Title:** "AI-Powered SDOH Intervention as Structural Racism Mitigation: Evidence from Mobile Health in Miami-Dade"

**Research Question:** How does systematic SDOH screening and navigation address structural barriers to health equity in racially/ethnically diverse communities?

**Framework:**
- Document structural barriers identified through Thrive screening
- Measure intervention effectiveness by race/ethnicity
- Generate evidence for policy recommendations

---

## Application Strategy

### Key Elements

1. **Structural Analysis:** Frame around systemic/structural factors, not individual behavior
2. **Community Leadership:** Demonstrate community voice in research design
3. **Policy Relevance:** Show how findings inform policy solutions
4. **Health Equity Metrics:** Disaggregate outcomes by race/ethnicity

### Recommended Framing

> "This research examines how AI-powered social determinants of health screening and navigation, delivered through community-trusted mobile health infrastructure, can generate evidence for addressing structural barriers to health equity in Miami-Dade County's racially and ethnically diverse communities..."

### What NOT to Do
- Avoid deficit framing of communities
- Don't focus on individual behavior change
- Avoid medicalized language without social context
- Don't ignore historical/structural context
