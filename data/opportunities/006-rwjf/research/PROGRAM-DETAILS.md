## Program Overview

Evidence for Action (E4A) is a Signature Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation based at the University of California, San Francisco. The program is dedicated to advancing action-oriented racial and Indigenous health equity research with an intentionally antiracist, anticolonial approach focused on community-driven solutions.

---

## Critical Notice: Program Transition

**IMPORTANT:** Evidence for Action, along with Health Data for Action, Policies for Action, and Systems for Action, will close by the end of 2026 to make way for a new health equity research initiative launching in 2026.

E4A does not anticipate releasing additional calls for proposals beyond current offerings. Applicants should monitor RWJF.org for information about the new 2026 research program.

## Strategic Considerations for FIU/HWCOM

### Current Opportunity: New Research Support (Dec 17, 2025)

**Challenge:** CBO must be lead applicant; university cannot lead

**Strategy Options:**

1. **Partner with Miami-Dade CBO** - Find community organization with health equity track record to serve as lead; FIU as research partner
2. **Identify Existing RWJF Grantees** - Partner with organizations already in RWJF network
3. **Community Health Coalition** - Work with CHW organizations or community health coalitions

### Future Opportunity: New 2026 Initiative

Monitor for new research program announcement:
- May have different eligibility structure
- Focus on "shifting how we understand, create, share, and use research-generated information"
- Unknown timeline for CFP release

### Alternative Programs

Consider:
- **Exploring Equitable Futures** - For innovative AI/health approaches
- **2026 Research Initiative** - Wait for new program details
