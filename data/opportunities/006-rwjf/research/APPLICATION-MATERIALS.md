## Framing Guidance

### What RWJF Wants to See

| Theme | How to Address |
|-------|----------------|
| **Structural Racism** | Frame around systemic/structural factors causing inequity |
| **Community Power** | Show community leadership and decision-making authority |
| **Root Causes** | Focus on upstream determinants, not symptoms |
| **Policy Relevance** | Connect findings to policy/practice changes |
| **Health Equity Metrics** | Disaggregate outcomes by race/ethnicity |
| **Culture of Health** | Use RWJF framework language where appropriate |

### What to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why Problematic |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Deficit Framing** | Portrays communities as broken/lacking |
| **Individual Behavior Focus** | Ignores structural causes |
| **Medicalized Language** | Without social/structural context |
| **Ignoring History** | Missing historical/structural context |
| **Top-Down Design** | Research designed without community input |
| **Tokenistic Engagement** | Advisory only, no decision authority |

### Sample Framing Language

**Strong Opening:**
> "This research examines how structural barriers in [specific system] create and perpetuate health inequities in [community], and tests community-designed interventions to address these root causes..."

**Weak Opening to Avoid:**
> "This study will examine health behaviors in underserved populations to identify individual-level interventions to improve health outcomes..."

## Strategic Recommendations for FIU/HWCOM

### Current Opportunity Challenge

**Issue:** Evidence for Action requires a community-based organization (CBO) as the lead applicant. Universities and research institutions cannot serve as lead.

### Recommended Approach

#### Option 1: Partner with Miami-Dade CBO (Recommended)

**Steps:**
1. Identify CBOs with track record in racial/Indigenous health equity
2. Propose partnership where CBO leads, FIU provides research expertise
3. Develop shared governance structure
4. CBO submits as lead applicant

**Potential CBO Partners:**
- Community health coalitions
- CHW organizations
- Faith-based health organizations
- Immigrant/refugee service organizations
- Tribal health organizations

#### Option 2: Wait for 2026 Initiative

**Rationale:**
- New research program launching 2026 may have different eligibility
- Focus on "shifting how we understand, create, share, and use research-generated information"
- Unknown if universities can be direct applicants

**Action:**
- Sign up for RWJF funding alerts
- Monitor announcements
- Build CBO relationships in the meantime

#### Option 3: Exploring Equitable Futures Alternative

**Note:** Closed for 2025, but may reopen

**Fit:**
- Accepts university applicants
- Focus on innovative/unconventional ideas
- AI and health science knowledge system priority
- Could frame AI-enhanced Thrive as unconventional approach

### Building Pipeline Relationship

Regardless of immediate application:
1. Register for RWJF funding alerts
2. Attend RWJF webinars and convenings
3. Review RWJF grantee database for similar work
4. Connect with RWJF grantees for advice
5. Build CBO partnerships for future opportunities
6. Document community-driven research approach
