## Culture of Health Action Framework

Developed in partnership with RAND Corporation, the Culture of Health framework identifies four action areas:

### Action Area 1: Making Health a Shared Value
- Cross-sectoral mindset about health
- Civic engagement in health matters
- Sense of community responsibility

### Action Area 2: Fostering Cross-Sector Collaboration
- Partnerships beyond traditional health sector
- Community engagement and collaboration
- Leveraging shared goals across fields

### Action Area 3: Creating Healthier, More Equitable Communities
- Built environment and physical conditions
- Social and economic conditions
- Policy and governance focus on equity

### Action Area 4: Strengthening Integration of Health Services
- Access to care
- Consumer experience and quality
- Healthcare system balance

**Key Insight:** "A Culture of Health will not be achieved by focusing on each action area alone, but by recognizing the interdependence of each area."
