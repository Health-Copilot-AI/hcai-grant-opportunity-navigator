## Application Process

### Current Program Transitions (2026)

**CRITICAL NOTE**: RWJF's four signature research programs are winding down by end of 2026:
- **Evidence for Action (E4A)** - Final calls released; no new CFPs anticipated
- **Systems for Action (S4A)** - Final CFP June 2025
- **Policies for Action (P4A)** - Winding down
- **Health Data for Action (HD4A)** - Winding down

**New Initiative**: A new research program will launch in 2026, focusing on "shifting how we understand, create, share, and use research-generated information to catalyze changes for a healthier, more just society."

### Application Types

| Program | Type | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Evidence for Action** | Open call with eligibility requirements | DEADLINE PASSED (Dec 17, 2025) |

## Strategic Alignment with FIU Programs

### NeighborhoodHELP Alignment

| RWJF Priority | NHELP Capability |
|---------------|------------------|
| Structural racism focus | Documents SDOH barriers faced by underserved communities |
| Community-driven solutions | Mobile health model demonstrates community trust and engagement |
| Health equity outcomes | Serves racially/ethnically diverse populations |
| Healthcare system equity | Integrated care delivery addressing access barriers |
| Cross-sector collaboration | Healthcare + social services partnership model |

### FIU Thrive Alignment

| RWJF Priority | Thrive Capability |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Health equity research | AI-powered SDOH data collection and analysis |
| Evidence generation | Systematic screening generates policy-relevant evidence |
| Structural intervention | Identifies and addresses systemic barriers |
| Measurable outcomes | Disaggregated data by race/ethnicity |
| Systems change potential | Findings can inform policy recommendations |

### Strong Alignment Indicators

1. **Structural Racism Focus** - RWJF's central priority aligns with documenting and addressing SDOH barriers
2. **Community-Driven Research** - Mobile health model demonstrates community trust and engagement
3. **Health Equity Outcomes** - Disaggregated outcomes by race/ethnicity match RWJF requirements
4. **Systems Change Potential** - Thrive model can generate policy-relevant evidence
5. **Cross-Sector Approach** - Healthcare + social services integration matches RWJF priorities

### Potential Challenges

1. **National Competition** - RWJF attracts top researchers nationwide
2. **Community-Led Requirement** - E4A requires CBO as lead applicant (universities as partners)
3. **Program Transition** - Signature programs ending; new priorities unclear for 2026
4. **Application Burden** - Significant effort required for competitive applications

### Recommended Approach

**Primary Strategy**: Position as research partner with community-based organization lead for future E4A-style opportunities

**Secondary Strategy**: Monitor 2026 new research initiative for direct application opportunities

**Alternative**: Explore Exploring Equitable Futures for innovative/unconventional approaches

**Application Positioning**:
1. Frame around **structural racism** and systemic barriers (not individual behavior)
2. Demonstrate **authentic community partnership** and leadership
3. Show **policy relevance** of research findings
4. Use **Culture of Health** language and framework
5. Emphasize **health equity metrics** disaggregated by race/ethnicity

### What to Avoid

- Deficit framing of communities
- Individual behavior change focus without structural context
- Medicalized language without social context
- Ignoring historical/structural context
- Top-down research design without community involvement

## Strategic Notes

1. **Timing is Critical**: With signature programs ending in 2026, monitor closely for new research initiative announcement. Position FIU for early engagement when new program details emerge.

2. **Community Partnership Required**: Evidence for Action and similar programs require CBO lead applicant. Identify and cultivate relationships with Miami-Dade CBOs serving racially/ethnically diverse communities.

3. **Structural Racism Framing Essential**: RWJF has made dismantling structural racism central to mission. All proposals must explicitly address systemic barriers, not individual behavior change.

4. **Culture of Health Language**: Use RWJF's framework language - "Culture of Health," "health equity," "systems change," "community-driven," "cross-sector collaboration."

5. **Evidence + Action Orientation**: RWJF funds research that generates actionable evidence for policy and systems change. Thrive model's ability to document structural barriers and generate policy recommendations is strong alignment.

6. **South Florida Connection**: Palm Beach County's 2024 Culture of Health Prize win demonstrates RWJF interest in South Florida health equity work. Leverage regional momentum.

7. **Prestige Factor**: RWJF grants are highly competitive and prestigious. Success would significantly enhance FIU's national health equity research profile.

8. **Long-Term Relationship Building**: RWJF is relationship-oriented. Engage program officers, attend RWJF convenings, build visibility in health equity research community.

9. **Multi-Year Funding Potential**: RWJF supports multi-year grants for significant initiatives. Frame proposals with 3-5 year timelines for systems change impact.

10. **Beyond Direct Grants**: Explore RWJF's leadership programs (Health Equity Scholars), convening opportunities, and policy advocacy networks for broader engagement.
