### Extracted Content

**Core Vision:**
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation pursues a transformative goal: "a future where health is no longer a privilege, but a right." RWJF describes itself as dedicated to "taking bold leaps to transform health in our lifetime."

**Three Generational Goals:**

1. **Economic Inclusion for Family Wellbeing** - Tax and caregiving systems that enable families to meet basic needs without impossible choices

2. **Equitable and Accountable Public Health and Healthcare Systems** - Healthcare delivery that is trustworthy, responsive to communities, and universally accessible

3. **Healthy and Equitable Community Conditions** - Universal access to safe housing, clean water, living-wage employment, and dignified treatment

**Seven Strategic Systems:**
RWJF targets structural racism and discrimination across:
- Community Development
- Economic Inclusion for Families
- Government
- Health Science Knowledge
- Healthcare
- Media
- Public Health

**Leadership Perspective:**
President and CEO Richard E. Besser emphasizes: "To achieve health equity, we have to uproot this hierarchy of human value." He identifies systemic devaluation based on race, class, and other factors as the fundamental barrier.

**Operational Approach:**
RWJF amplifies community-driven solutions through grantee partnerships, research, policy advocacy, and diversity initiatives across health professions and data collection practices.

## Culture of Health Framework

**Source:** PMC and RAND research publications

### Extracted Content

**Background:**
In 2013, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) embarked on a pioneering effort to advance a Culture of Health initiative. A Culture of Health places well-being at the center of every aspect of life, with the goal of enabling everyone in our diverse society to lead healthier lives, now and for generations to come.

**Framework Development:**
To put this vision into action, RWJF worked with RAND to develop an action framework that identifies how the nation will work toward achieving these outcomes.

**The Four Action Areas:**

The Culture of Health action framework is designed around four action areas and one outcome area. Action areas are the core areas in which investment and activity are needed:

1. **Making Health a Shared Value**
2. **Fostering Cross-Sector Collaboration to Improve Well-Being**
3. **Creating Healthier, More Equitable Communities**
4. **Strengthening Integration of Health Services and Systems**

Each action area contains a set of drivers indicating where the United States needs to accelerate change and a set of measures illustrating places for progress.

**Key Insights from Progress Reports:**

- Making Health a Shared Value (Action Area 1) emerged as a necessary element to advancing a Culture of Health
- Cross-Sector Collaborations (Action Area 2) were found to foster the development of all the other Action Areas
- Building a Culture of Health requires collaborating with partners often in other fields, and finding points of leverage to achieve shared goals
- Initiatives focused on Creating Healthier, More Equitable Communities (Action Area 3) to improve health and health equity were often motivated by an acknowledgement of residents' health and social needs
- Health equity was viewed as pivotal to advancing a Culture of Health, but integrating health equity can and should occur at different levels

**Implementation Approach:**
A Culture of Health will not be achieved by focusing on each action area alone, but by recognizing the interdependence of each area. Implementing the framework will take time and involve collaboration across multiple sectors - beyond the traditional public health field. Advancing a Culture of Health has to be local and tailored to context and requires agility, flexibility, and creativity.
