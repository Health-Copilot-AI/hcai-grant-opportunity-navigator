## Key Messaging Points

### Structural Focus (CRITICAL)
⚠️ **DO NOT focus on individual behavior change**
⚠️ **DO frame around systemic/structural barriers**

**Good Framing:**
- Structural barriers to care access
- Policy-level interventions
- System change approaches
- Community power building

**Avoid:**
- Individual health behaviors
- Deficit framing of communities
- Medicalized language without context
- Ignoring historical/structural factors

### Recommended Framing
> "This research examines how AI-powered social determinants of health screening and navigation, delivered through community-trusted mobile health infrastructure, can generate evidence for addressing structural barriers to health equity in Miami-Dade County's racially and ethnically diverse communities..."
