## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### CCBHC-Specific Pitfalls

- **Missing State Concurrence Letter**: Start outreach to Florida DCF immediately - this letter is REQUIRED and cannot be waived. Applications without it will be deemed non-responsive.

- **Underestimating 24/7 Crisis Services Requirement**: Crisis services must be available 24/7/365. If not providing directly, must have firm contractual agreement with crisis provider. Letters of support are not sufficient - need MOUs.

- **Exceeding $1M Annual Budget**: Budget limit is firm and includes both direct and indirect costs. Applications over limit will be rejected. Budget exactly to limit or slightly below.

- **Geographic Overlap**: Catchment area cannot overlap with existing CCBHC award. Verify no conflicts before investing time in application.

- **Inadequate DCO Documentation**: If contracting for required services, need detailed MOUs with each Designated Collaborating Organization, not just letters of support.

### Federal Application Pitfalls

- **Late Federal Registration**: SAM.gov registration can take 4-6 weeks. Don't wait until NOFO release to register.

- **Insufficient Budget Justification**: Every line item must be justified. "To be determined" or vague justifications lead to budget cuts or rejection.

- **Page Limit Violations**: Federal applications are strict on page limits. Exceeding limits results in rejection. Use 12pt font, 1-inch margins as required.

- **Missing Required Forms**: SF-424, SF-424A, and other standard forms are required. Missing forms = rejection.

- **Consumer Representation Gap**: CCBHC requires consumers in governance. If your board doesn't currently include individuals with behavioral health lived experience, describe recruitment plan.

### Strategic Pitfalls

- **Unrealistic Timeline**: Track 1 applicants must achieve full CCBHC compliance within 1 year. Ensure timeline is realistic for building capacity.

- **Weak Needs Assessment**: Need strong local data showing behavioral health service gaps. National statistics are insufficient.

- **Vague Evidence-Based Practices**: Must specify which evidence-based practices will be used for which populations/conditions.

- **Inadequate Evaluation Plan**: Need concrete plan for measuring SAMHSA's required performance measures and demonstrating outcomes.
