## Strategic Notes

1. **Partnership Model Recommended**: Given CCBHC certification requirements (24/7 crisis services, comprehensive behavioral health staff, substance use disorder treatment), FIU/NeighborhoodHELP should consider partnering with an existing Florida CCBHC (especially Community Health of South Florida in Miami-Dade) rather than pursuing independent CCBHC certification. Position NHELP as the **care coordination and SDOH infrastructure** supporting CCBHC clinical services.

2. **State Concurrence is Critical**: Any CCBHC application requires a formal letter from the Florida Department of Children and Families (state mental health authority) indicating concurrence and certification pathway. Early engagement with state officials is essential before applying.

3. **Track Selection Strategy**: CCBHC-PDI track is for NEW CCBHCs and requires achieving full certification within 1 year. CCBHC-IA track is only for organizations already certified or with prior CCBHC Expansion awards. FIU would need to pursue PDI track or partner with existing IA-eligible organization.

4. **FIU Thrive as Behavioral Health Platform**: The FIU Thrive digital platform could serve as the **care coordination technology backbone** for a CCBHC partnership, enabling integrated physical and behavioral health management, SDOH screening, and population health tracking—all CCBHC requirements.

5. **Timing for FY 2026 Opportunity**: CCBHC-IA grants (SM-26-015) are forecasted to be released **March 31, 2026**. If FIU intends to pursue this opportunity, partnership discussions with Community Health of South Florida or another certified CCBHC should begin immediately (February/March 2026) to allow adequate time for partnership formalization, concept development, and state engagement before the 60-day application window.

6. **Workforce Development Angle**: FIU HWCOM's behavioral health training programs align with SAMHSA's workforce development priorities. Applications could emphasize training pipeline for behavioral health professionals, peer support specialists, and integrated care providers.

7. **Congressional Support Despite Administration Proposals**: The FY 2026 appropriations process demonstrated bipartisan Congressional commitment to SAMHSA programs, rejecting proposed cuts. This suggests program stability for multi-year grant planning.

8. **FQHC Eligibility Confirmed**: Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) ARE eligible for CCBHC grants if they meet all requirements. If FIU/NHELP operates as or partners with an FQHC, this pathway remains viable.

## Strategic Alignment with FIU Programs

### NeighborhoodHELP Alignment

| CCBHC Requirement | NeighborhoodHELP Capability | Gap/Opportunity |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Community-based services | **Strong**: Household visits, mobile health, CHWs | None - core strength |
| Care coordination | **Strong**: CHW-led care coordination is central model | None - core strength |
| Primary care integration | **Strong**: Partnership with FIU HWCOM | None - core strength |
| SDOH screening and services | **Strong**: Housing, food, transportation support | None - core strength |
| Crisis services (24/7) | **Moderate**: Would need development | Partnership opportunity |
| Outpatient mental health services | **Moderate**: Limited current capacity | Partnership opportunity |
| Substance use disorder treatment | **Low**: Not current service line | Partnership opportunity |
| Peer support services | **Low**: Would need development | Training/hiring opportunity |
| Psychiatric rehabilitation | **Low**: Clinical capacity needed | Partnership opportunity |

### FIU Thrive Alignment

| CCBHC Requirement | FIU Thrive Capability | Gap/Opportunity |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Integrated care coordination | **Strong**: Platform designed for care integration | Platform could serve CCBHC tech infrastructure |
| Performance measurement | **Strong**: Data analytics, outcomes tracking | Meets CCBHC reporting requirements |
| Population health management | **Strong**: Risk stratification, panel management | Supports CCBHC quality improvement |
| Behavioral health module | **Moderate**: Could be enhanced | Development opportunity to add BH screening/tracking |
| EHR integration | **Strong**: Interoperability capabilities | Enables integrated physical/behavioral health records |

### Recommended Positioning

**Route 4: NeighborhoodHELP as Vehicle** - Behavioral health integration pathway:

1. **Partner with Community Health of South Florida** (existing Miami-Dade CCBHC) for clinical behavioral health services
2. **Position NeighborhoodHELP as care coordination infrastructure** - CHWs conduct home visits, SDOH interventions, treatment adherence support
3. **FIU Thrive as shared technology platform** - Integrated case management system for CCBHC
4. **FIU HWCOM as training partner** - Behavioral health workforce development, integrated care training
5. **Joint CCBHC-IA application** - Community Health SF as lead, FIU as care coordination/SDOH/training partner
