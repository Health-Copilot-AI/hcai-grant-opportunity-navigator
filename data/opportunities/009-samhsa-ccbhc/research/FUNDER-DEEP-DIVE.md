### Types of State Programs

|--------------|-------------|
| **Section 223 Demonstration** | States participating in the demonstration established under PAMA |
| **Independent State Programs** | States with CCBHC through Medicaid State Plan Amendment or Waiver |

### Certification Duration

- Maximum 3 years before recertification required
- Independent accreditation by accrediting body encouraged

### States WITH CCBHC Certification

CCBHC state certification is not currently available in all states. Check SAMHSA resources for current state certification status.
