### Full Press Release Content

On August 25, 2025, the Florida Blue Foundation, the philanthropic affiliate of Florida Blue and part of the GuideWell family of companies, announced it is now accepting grant applications from nonprofits focused on improving maternal health outcomes in Florida.

### Grant Focus

The Foundation seeks to fund Florida-based nonprofits with innovative and actionable solutions designed to improve maternal health outcomes and ensure access to quality health care services and support.

### AI-Powered Solutions Priority

Special consideration will be given to organizations that use innovative AI-powered solutions, such as chatbots or predictive analytics, and to those serving people living in under-resourced communities or rural counties.

### Application Deadline

Applications are due by Monday, October 6, 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).

### Funding Details

Florida Blue Foundation has earmarked approximately $3 million for the new grant program, offering three- and four-year grants. The latest round of grants, which will be announced in early 2026, will further accelerate progress in improving maternal health outcomes.

### Background

This is the Foundation's second round of funding for maternal health grants, building on its earlier 2025 investment of awarding $3.1 million to eight nonprofits. The grants awarded earlier this year are supporting programs such as nurse navigators, mobile clinics, telehealth services, community-based doulas, and evidence-based group treatment programs.

### Context on Maternal Health in Florida

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Florida's maternal mortality rate is higher than the national average, with 19.4 percent of the state's counties classified as "maternity care deserts."
