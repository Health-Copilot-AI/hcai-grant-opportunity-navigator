## AI-Powered Solutions - EXPLICITLY REQUESTED

### Foundation Statement

> "Special consideration will be given to organizations that use innovative AI-powered solutions, such as chatbots or predictive analytics, and to those serving people living in under-resourced communities or rural counties."

### Specific AI Applications Mentioned

| AI Solution Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Chatbots** | Automated patient communication and support |
| **Predictive Analytics** | Risk identification and intervention targeting |

### Why AI Matters

The Foundation has explicitly stated preference for AI-powered approaches because they can:
- Scale intervention reach
- Identify high-risk individuals early
- Personalize care pathways
- Improve efficiency of limited resources
- Enable proactive rather than reactive care

---

## Geographic Priorities

### Target Communities

1. **Under-resourced communities** - Areas with limited healthcare access
2. **Rural counties** - 19.4% of Florida counties are "maternity care deserts"
3. **Food deserts** - Areas with limited access to healthy food (relevant to chronic conditions)

### Florida Context

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Maternal Mortality Rate** | Higher than national average |
| **Maternity Care Deserts** | 19.4% of counties |
| **CDC Assessment** | Florida identified as priority state |
