## Key Messaging Points

- **Health Innovation Alignment**: Frame project within Dell's Community Health Integration pillar - emphasize that "well-being is shaped by everyday environments" and demonstrate how Thrive/NHELP connects clinical care with housing, nutrition, education, and other SDOH factors.

- **Factor Health Model Parallel**: Reference Dell Medical School's Factor Health initiative as a parallel model - bringing together community organizations, healthcare payers, and (potentially) investors to test and sustain non-clinical interventions. Position FIU as replicating this proven approach in Miami.

- **Evidence-Based, Results-Driven**: Align with Dell's core philosophy that "ideas are a commodity, execution is not" - emphasize documented outcomes, not theoretical possibilities. Provide numeric evidence at every opportunity.

- **Scalability Beyond Florida**: Address geographic limitation head-on - Miami-Dade County as proof-of-concept for national model. Identify 2-3 other urban areas where model could be replicated and partners who could implement.

- **Technology as Enabler, Not Endpoint**: Frame AI/technology capabilities as tools to improve family health outcomes, not as technology projects. Reference Coursemojo example (AI for literacy outcomes) - Dell funds tech when it demonstrably improves lives.

- **Family-Centered, Youth-Focused**: Emphasize direct service to children and youth from urban low-income communities - align with Dell's mission of serving families and "Everyone Deserves Opportunity" tagline.

- **Partnership Sustainability**: Demonstrate engagement with healthcare payers and community organizations for long-term sustainability - not just FIU-led initiative but true ecosystem collaboration.

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

- **SDOH Screening and Navigation at Scale**: AI-enabled platform for comprehensive SDOH screening, resource matching, and community health worker navigation for low-income families in Miami-Dade County

- **Preventive Care Integration**: Technology platform connecting clinical primary care with community-based SDOH interventions to reduce emergency department utilization and improve chronic disease management

- **Youth Mental Health + SDOH**: Integrated approach addressing youth mental health through both clinical services and social determinants (housing stability, food security, education support) - aligns with Factor Health's youth mental health focus

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **Thrive Platform National Scalability Initiative**: Scale FIU Thrive's AI-powered SDOH screening and navigation platform to serve 100,000+ families in Miami-Dade County with documented replication toolkit for 3-5 additional urban markets. Demonstrate 25% reduction in preventable ED visits and 40% improvement in chronic disease management through integrated community health worker support.

2. **Community Health Integration Partnership**: Multi-sector collaboration with Miami-Dade County health plans, FQHCs, and CBOs to establish sustainable referral pathways between clinical care and community resources. Technology-enabled care coordination with measurable outcomes for maternal health, pediatric care, and chronic disease prevention.

3. **AI-Enabled Family Health Coaching**: Culturally tailored, AI-supported health coaching platform delivered through community health workers to address multiple SDOH barriers simultaneously (food insecurity, housing instability, healthcare access) for families with children 0-18 in under-resourced Miami neighborhoods.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Emphasize FIU's unique position**: Only medical school in Miami-Dade County, serving one of nation's most diverse urban populations, with existing community infrastructure through NeighborhoodHELP

- **AI differentiation**: While many organizations do SDOH screening, FIU Thrive's AI capabilities for risk stratification and predictive modeling differentiate approach (parallel to Dell's Coursemojo literacy AI investment)

- **Measurement rigor**: Commit to evaluation standards matching Dell's results-driven philosophy - quarterly outcome reporting, independent evaluation, real-time dashboard for tracking progress toward 1M families goal

- **National replication ready**: Don't just propose Miami project - provide detailed scalability plan with identified partners in 3+ other markets, cost projections for replication, and technology transfer process

## Health Innovation Alignment Requirements

### Community Health Integration Pillar (Primary Fit)

- [ ] Demonstrate focus on preventive care and social determinants of health
- [ ] Show how project connects clinical care with everyday environment factors (housing, nutrition, education)
- [ ] Emphasize non-clinical interventions that improve health outcomes
- [ ] Align with "well-being is shaped by everyday environments" philosophy

### Dell Medical School Factor Health Model (Reference Point)

- [ ] Include community-based organizations as core partners
- [ ] Engage healthcare payers in sustainability plan
- [ ] Consider investor/social enterprise model for long-term viability
- [ ] Address chronic disease and/or youth mental health (Factor Health priorities)

### Access to Excellence Pillar (Secondary Fit)

- [ ] If relevant: Position FIU HWCOM as academic medical institution training future physicians
- [ ] Demonstrate how project ensures under-resourced families access top-tier care

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Requesting hardware/equipment**: Dell Foundation explicitly does NOT fund computers, tablets, or other technology hardware. Request only software development, AI platform licenses, or technical services.

- **Medical research framing**: Dell excludes "medical research initiatives" as standalone projects. Frame as implementation, delivery, or community health intervention - NOT as research study. (IRB approval is fine; research as primary goal is not.)

- **Ignoring the 25% cap**: Many organizations request too much. If project budget is $2M, Dell can fund maximum $500K. Design budget accordingly with clear match sources identified.

- **Vague outcomes**: "Improve health" is insufficient. Dell requires numeric evidence - "Reduce preventable ED visits by 25% among 5,000 enrolled families over 24 months, measured by EHR data analysis."

- **Texas-only mindset**: Don't assume Dell only funds Texas. They have national reach, but you must make compelling case for why Miami project merits investment - usually through scalability/replication narrative.

- **Ignoring sustainability**: Grants end. Dell wants to see pathway to continued impact beyond grant period. One-time projects with no sustainability plan will not be competitive.

- **Generic proposals**: Dell receives many applications. Differentiate through specific evidence, unique assets (AI platform, academic medical center, community infrastructure), and measurable commitments.

- **Missing baseline data**: Cannot start application without documented Point A. If FIU Thrive/NHELP lacks baseline data, delay application until evidence base is established.

## Additional Strategic Notes

### Dell Foundation's Distinctive Characteristics

1. **Results-Obsessed**: More than most funders, Dell emphasizes execution and measurable outcomes. Every claim should be supported by data.

2. **Scale-Oriented**: With $7.77B in assets and $3B in total commitments, Dell thinks big. Projects should have ambition matching foundation's scope.

3. **Multi-Year Commitment**: 36-month grants signal Dell's willingness to invest in sustained change, not just one-year pilots.

4. **Partnership Model**: Dell brings together multiple stakeholders (as seen in Factor Health). Proposals should reflect ecosystem approach, not isolated interventions.

5. **Geographic Flexibility**: While Texas is priority, foundation has national reach and has funded projects across U.S. when scalability case is compelling.

### Why Dell Might Fund FIU Thrive/NHELP

- **Underserved Urban Population**: Miami-Dade County's demographics and health disparities align with Dell's urban low-income community focus
- **Technology Innovation**: AI-enabled SDOH platform differentiates from traditional CHW programs
- **Medical School Asset**: Academic medical center provides research capacity, workforce development, and legitimacy
- **Scalability Potential**: Technology platform can be replicated more easily than purely human-delivered interventions
- **Evidence Base**: If FIU has documented outcomes, this meets Dell's evidence-based requirement
- **SDOH Emphasis**: Aligns perfectly with Community Health Integration pillar and Factor Health model

### Why Dell Might NOT Fund FIU Thrive/NHELP

- **Geographic Distance from Texas**: Florida lacks the proximity advantage of Texas-based organizations
- **Insufficient Evidence**: If baseline data and outcomes are not well-documented, application will be non-competitive
- **Limited Scalability**: If project is too Miami-specific without clear replication pathway, doesn't match Dell's scale orientation
- **Weak Sustainability Plan**: If project depends entirely on grant funding with no pathway to payer integration or revenue model, Dell may pass
- **Crowded Field**: Health Innovation is explicit priority, likely attracting many competitive applications

### Recommended Pre-Application Actions

1. **Audit Evidence Base**: Conduct honest assessment of FIU Thrive/NHELP evaluation data. If insufficient, invest in evaluation infrastructure before applying.

2. **Explore Austin Connections**: Research whether any FIU faculty have connections to Dell Medical School, Factor Health, or Austin healthcare community. Relationships matter.

3. **Study Coursemojo Grant**: Review Dell's $2.4M grant to Coursemojo for AI-powered literacy. What parallels exist with FIU Thrive's AI approach? How can you demonstrate similar evidence-based outcomes?

4. **Engage Healthcare Payers Early**: Don't wait until application to contact Miami-Dade Medicaid MCOs or health plans. Build relationships demonstrating payer interest in sustainability.

5. **Map National Replication Sites**: Identify 3-5 specific cities where FIU Thrive model could be replicated. Make contacts at comparable academic medical centers to demonstrate replication interest.

6. **Quantify Everything**: Convert qualitative claims to quantitative evidence. "Families report feeling healthier" becomes "87% of enrolled families demonstrated improvement on validated health assessment tool (n=342)."
