## Strategic Fit Assessment: FIU Thrive/NeighborhoodHELP

### Alignment Strengths

| Factor | Alignment | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Health Innovation Priority** | STRONG | Explicit focus area with $1M families target |
| **SDOH Approach** | STRONG | Foundation emphasizes connecting care with housing, nutrition, education |
| **Community Health Workers** | STRONG | Austin ACH project uses CHW model |
| **Evidence-Based Requirement** | MODERATE | Need strong outcomes data |
| **Texas Geographic Priority** | LOW | Florida not priority, but national considered |
| **Technology/AI Innovation** | MODERATE | Funds AI tools (literacy), but excludes hardware |

### Potential Challenges

1. **Geographic Focus**: Texas and Greater Austin are priorities; Florida would need strong national replication narrative
2. **Medical Research Exclusion**: Need to frame as implementation/delivery, not research
3. **Hardware Exclusion**: Cannot request technology equipment
4. **Competitive**: High-profile funder with selective portfolio

### Recommended Framing

1. **Lead with SDOH**: Emphasize social determinants approach aligning with Factor Health model
2. **Scalability Narrative**: Position as model for national replication
3. **Evidence-Based Outcomes**: Compile strong quantitative impact data
4. **AI as Enabler**: Frame AI capabilities as tools for improved outcomes, not technology for its own sake
5. **Family-Centered**: Align with mission of serving families and children from low-income communities
