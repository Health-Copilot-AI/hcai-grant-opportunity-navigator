## Key Messaging Points

- **Funder Priority Alignment**: Frame project as directly addressing elderly care OR suicide prevention (two of foundation's top priorities). Mention Alzheimer's support, cancer support, or domestic violence if applicable.

- **Population Alignment**: Emphasize that project directly serves elderly patients or high-risk seniors. Connect to suicide prevention through mental health screening data.

- **AI Innovation Angle**: Highlight Thrive's AI-powered screening for elderly mental health needs—this differentiates from basic services (which foundation does not fund).

- **Track Record Evidence**: Share NHELP data on elderly patients served, NeighborhoodHELP clinical outcomes. Share Thrive mental health screening data and patient engagement rates.

- **One-Time Grant Sustainability**: Acknowledge this is one-time funding; explain how initial grant enables sustainable program components or demonstrates proof-of-concept for larger funding.

- **Measurable Outcomes**: Foundation expects reporting on grant use—provide clear, achievable metrics (e.g., "screens 150 seniors for depression and social isolation," "identifies 40 seniors at risk for suicide," "refers 60 elderly patients to additional care").

- **Elderly/Patient Focus**: Foundation serves "patients" and "elderly populations"—ensure all framing emphasizes direct benefit to these populations, not infrastructure or research.

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

1. **Elderly Care & Mental Health Screening**: AI-powered assessment of elderly patients' mental health and social isolation risk during community outreach
2. **Suicide Prevention for Seniors**: Identify and support elderly patients at risk for suicide through enhanced screening and referral
3. **Elderly Patient Support**: Integrated care coordination for elderly patients managing chronic conditions (Alzheimer's, cancer, domestic violence aftermath)

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **"Senior Mental Health Screening Pilot"**: Use Thrive technology to screen 150 elderly patients in NHELP clinics for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk; provide referrals and follow-up support. Award size: $15,000-$25,000. Timeline: 12 months.

2. **"Elderly Care Outreach Enhancement"**: Fund community health worker positions to conduct home-based screening and support for isolated elderly patients in low-income neighborhoods; integrate with NHELP services. Award size: $20,000-$30,000. Timeline: 12 months, with transition to NHELP budget afterward.

3. **"Suicide Prevention for Vulnerable Seniors"**: Develop and pilot screening protocol for elderly patients at risk for suicide; train NHELP clinical staff; measure identification and referral rates. Award size: $10,000-$15,000. Timeline: 12 months.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Measurable Focus**: Other applications may propose broad elderly support; differentiate by proposing specific, measurable interventions (screening, referral, follow-up numbers)
- **Innovation Lever**: Emphasize Thrive's AI integration—foundation likely receives many traditional service proposals; highlight technology-enabled care coordination
- **Community Data**: Include local data on elderly mental health needs in Miami/South Florida; show this project fills a specific gap
- **Realistic Scope**: $15K-$25K grants work best for focused, time-limited pilots; avoid overambitious proposals for this budget range

## Critical Reminders

- **One-Time Grants Only**: Foundation explicitly awards only one-time grants. This is not renewable. Plan for sustainability beyond 12 months.
- **Only One Application Per Year**: FIU can only submit one application to this foundation per calendar year.
- **Ineligible Uses**: Do NOT request funds for capital campaigns, political campaigns, lobbying, equipment purchases (with rare exceptions), endowments, direct services, or media production.
- **Eligibility Check**: Foundation funds organizations serving elderly populations and patients with specific health conditions. Frame project around elderly care or suicide prevention, not research or infrastructure.
- **Reporting Requirement**: If awarded, foundation will expect reporting on how grant was used. Develop clear metrics and tracking plan.
- **Realistic Expectations**: This foundation has moderate award sizes ($5K-$30K); target around $15K for typical award. Avoid overly ambitious proposals for this budget range.
