## Key Messaging Points

- **Unrestricted Operating Support Focus**: Emphasize that AFM's Tau Grant provides flexible funding that strengthens organizational infrastructure—personnel stability, technology systems, strategic capacity. Frame NHELP's need not as project-specific but as organizational strengthening for sustained community service.

- **Geographic & Population Alignment**: "NHELP serves primarily BIPOC communities in Miami-Dade County, directly aligning with AFM's core service area and population priorities. Operating support ensures we can maintain community presence and trust-based relationships essential to healthcare access work."

- **Healthcare Access + Equity Mission Alignment**: Connect operating support to AFM's explicit FY25 focus on healthcare access. Frame as: "NHELP's operating support enables sustained mobile health services reaching underinsured and uninsured Miami-Dade residents, directly advancing AFM's healthcare access priorities."

- **Community-Driven Approach**: Highlight NHELP's community health worker model and resident leadership, demonstrating alignment with AFM's "patient urgency" approach and emphasis on shifting power to communities. Note that 25%+ of leadership/staff are from BIPOC communities served.

- **Sustainability & Long-Term Impact**: Unrestricted support enables strategic investments (technology, professional development, infrastructure) that position NHELP for long-term sustainability beyond the grant period. Show multi-year organizational plan.

- **Capacity Building Philosophy**: Position grant as capacity-building investment rather than project funding. AFM explicitly prefers general operating support—this aligns perfectly with organizational needs.

- **Financial Stewardship**: Document organizational fiscal health and responsible resource management. Show how previous funding has been stewarded effectively.

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

- **Unrestricted Operating Support for Healthcare Access**: Rather than proposing a new project, request general operating support framed around sustaining healthcare access work with BIPOC Miami-Dade communities
- **Community Health Worker Model Sustainability**: Position grant as enabling CHW salary stability, training, and professional development
- **Technology Infrastructure for Health Equity**: Emphasize how operating support funds technology improvements (EHR systems, telehealth capacity, community outreach platforms) enabling better healthcare access
- **Organizational Strategic Planning & Capacity**: Frame support as enabling NHELP to strengthen systems, strategic planning, and community engagement infrastructure

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **"Sustaining Healthcare Access Through Community Health Workers"**: Request general operating support to maintain CHW positions and salaries, community engagement infrastructure, and technology systems serving Miami-Dade BIPOC communities. Emphasize sustainability and capacity rather than new program expansion.

2. **"Building Community-Trusted Healthcare Infrastructure"**: Position operating support as enabling organizational systems that deepen community trust and accessibility—staff stability, culturally competent service delivery, community leadership development. Document how unrestricted funds strengthen relationships and presence in Miami-Dade neighborhoods.

3. **"Healthcare Equity through Organizational Excellence"**: Frame operating support as investment in NHELP's organizational capacity—strategic planning, professional development, quality systems, community partnership infrastructure—that ultimately improves health outcomes for underserved BIPOC populations.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Emphasis on Community Trust**: Highlight that community-based healthcare access requires sustained, trusted presence—unrestricted support enables this stability more effectively than project-specific funding
- **Authentic Community Leadership**: Document genuine community and staff diversity in leadership (meet 25% threshold). Show how program decisions are shaped by community voice, not just organizational priorities
- **Long-Term Sustainability Focus**: AFM values sustainable impact. Demonstrate how organizational capacity-building with unrestricted support creates conditions for lasting health equity work
- **Alignment with Common Good Initiative**: NHELP's place-based, community-driven approach mirrors AFM's successful Common Good Initiative. Position as partnership in community-driven health transformation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Missing the operating budget threshold**: Confirm organizational budget is clearly under $1 million to meet eligibility. Document this explicitly in application.

- **Insufficient community diversity documentation**: AFM requires 50%+ of populations served AND 25%+ of staff/leadership diversity from priority populations. Verify numbers early; this is non-negotiable eligibility criterion.

- **Proposing restricted/project-specific use**: AFM Tau Grants are for unrestricted operating support. Avoid framing as project grant. Position as organizational capacity-building that enables healthcare access work.

- **Applying as FIU directly (public university exclusion)**: Remember AFM excludes direct public university applications. Must apply through FIU Foundation or appropriate 501(c)(3). Confirm structure early.

- **Requesting ongoing/renewable funding**: AFM states grants are not intended for ongoing annual renewal. Frame as strengthening organizational capacity for sustainability, not as multi-year recurring support.

- **Weak community voice narrative**: AFM's "patient urgency" philosophy and community-driven approach require authentic community engagement language. Include community perspectives, not just organizational needs.

- **Misalignment with Catholic Social Teaching**: While not explicitly required, AFM's Franciscan values emphasize dignity, service to vulnerable, right relationships, stewardship. Ensure implicit values alignment even if not explicitly Catholic organization.

- **Budget that exceeds two-year maximum**: Remember $20,000 is maximum across TWO years, not per year. Structure budget with clear two-year allocation.
