## Grantmaking Philosophy

### Approach
1. **General operating support** over restricted project funding
2. **Capacity-building investments** for organizational strength
3. **Advocacy initiatives** for systemic change
4. **Community-driven priorities** over funder-driven agendas

### Power Dynamics Awareness
Leadership quote: "In community-based work, we find ourselves having moved into a position of power that we did not intend, and now have to be more deliberate about transitioning it back."

### "Patient Urgency"
Balancing realistic timelines with meaningful impact while actively working to redistribute power to communities rather than consolidating funder control.

## Relevance to NeighborhoodHELP/FIU Thrive

### Alignment Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Geographic Match | HIGH | Miami-Dade County explicitly included |
| Population Focus | HIGH | BIPOC, vulnerable populations - direct match |
| Healthcare Access | HIGH | Cycle 1 specifically targets healthcare access |
| Community-Driven | HIGH | Emphasis on community-driven approaches |
| Equity Focus | HIGH | Health equity central to mission |

### Potential Challenges

1. **Budget Threshold**: Operating budget must be under $1M-$2M - FIU as institution may exceed this
2. **Public University Restriction**: FIU cannot apply directly; would need to apply through FIU Foundation
3. **Leadership Diversity Requirement**: Must demonstrate 25% of leadership from priority populations
4. **Grant Size**: $20,000 over two years is modest for large programs

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Apply Through FIU Foundation**: Structure application through the university foundation to meet eligibility
2. **Emphasize Community Leadership**: Highlight community health workers and resident leaders in program leadership
3. **Focus on Healthcare Access**: Align proposal with Cycle 1 priority - healthcare access for underserved
4. **Demonstrate Population Served**: Document that >50% of populations served are BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, or immigrant
5. **Leverage Common Good Alignment**: Connect to AFM's community-driven, place-based approach
