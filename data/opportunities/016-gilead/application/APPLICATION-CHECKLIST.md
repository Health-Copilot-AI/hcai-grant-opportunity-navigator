## Key Messaging Points

- **Funder Priority Alignment**: Gilead's "Access and Health Equity" pillar aligns perfectly with NHELP's safety net services and Thrive's SDOH screening. Emphasize systematic identification of social barriers (food, housing, transportation) and connection to community resources - core to Gilead's "Health for All" mission.

- **Prior Relationship Leverage**: If FIU or HWCOM has any prior Gilead connections (research collaborations, therapeutic area partnerships), mention them. If not, position as new partner bringing community-based SDOH innovation that aligns with Gilead's expanding portfolio beyond therapeutic areas.

- **Unique Value Proposition**: "FIU's integration of AI-powered SDOH screening (Thrive platform) with mobile community health delivery (NHELP) creates a systematic, technology-enabled approach to identifying and addressing social barriers to health in Miami-Dade's most underserved communities."

- **Track Record Evidence**:
  - 92,000+ uninsured/underinsured patients served by NHELP
  - Established mobile health unit infrastructure reaching communities where barriers are highest
  - CHW workforce trained in culturally competent care
  - Closed-loop referral tracking capability through Thrive

- **Community Engagement**: NHELP's model IS community engagement - meeting patients where they are, in trusted community settings. Emphasize household-level health assessments, family-centered care, and partnerships with community organizations that address identified needs.

- **Innovation/Distinctiveness**: Thrive platform's AI-enhanced SDOH assessment distinguishes FIU from traditional screening approaches. Technology enables systematic, scalable identification of social needs with data-driven referral tracking - demonstrating both innovation and accountability.

- **Sustainability Path**: Thrive platform becomes permanent NHELP infrastructure. CHWs trained in SDOH screening continue using tool beyond grant period. Partnerships established with social service agencies create ongoing referral pathways. Data generated demonstrates value for future funding.

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

- **SDOH Screening and Intervention**: Systematic screening of NHELP patients for food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, and connection to community resources
- **Technology-Enabled Health Equity**: Leveraging Thrive's AI platform to identify vulnerable populations and track closed-loop referrals
- **Community Health Worker Capacity Building**: Training CHWs in SDOH assessment and navigation to social services
- **Safety Net Integration**: Strengthening connections between healthcare delivery (NHELP) and social service providers

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **"Thrive-Powered SDOH Navigation for Underserved Communities"**: Deploy Thrive platform across NHELP mobile units to systematically screen patients for social determinants of health, train CHWs as SDOH navigators, and establish closed-loop referrals to food banks, housing support, and transportation services. Target 5,000 patients screened, 2,000 connected to resources, measurable health outcomes (medication adherence, chronic disease control) improved.

2. **"Building Community Resilience Through Integrated SDOH Screening"**: Expand NHELP's household health assessments to include comprehensive SDOH screening via Thrive platform, create partnerships with Miami-Dade social service agencies for warm handoffs, and track patient outcomes through technology-enabled follow-up. Demonstrates how addressing social barriers improves health outcomes for uninsured populations.

3. **"Technology-Enabled Health Equity: AI-Powered SDOH Assessment in Mobile Health"**: Pilot innovative use of artificial intelligence to identify SDOH risk factors in real-time during NHELP patient encounters, automate referrals to appropriate community resources, and generate data on SDOH prevalence and intervention effectiveness in Miami-Dade's safety net population.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Technology + Community**: Most SDOH screening is paper-based and disconnected. Thrive brings AI-powered assessment with closed-loop tracking - innovation meets community trust.
- **Established Infrastructure**: NHELP's 92,000+ patient base and mobile unit infrastructure means immediate implementation, not building from scratch.
- **Academic-Community Partnership**: FIU brings both research rigor (evaluation, data) and deep community presence (NHELP's trusted relationships).
- **Scalability**: Technology platform enables replication beyond initial pilot - Gilead values approaches that can grow.
- **Florida Presence**: If emphasizing COMPASS Initiative connection (HIV in Southern U.S. including Florida), position SDOH screening as addressing barriers to HIV testing/care in vulnerable communities.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Generic SDOH Language**: Gilead wants specific, measurable approaches to addressing social determinants. Avoid vague statements about "addressing social needs" - specify EXACTLY which needs (food, housing, transportation), HOW they'll be identified (Thrive screening), and HOW patients connect to resources (CHW navigation, specific partner organizations).

- **Missing the "Access and Health Equity" Pillar Connection**: Applications must clearly align with one of Gilead's three Building Community pillars. For FIU, "Access and Health Equity" is the strongest fit - explicitly name this pillar and show how your project advances safety net services and holistic community health.

- **Underestimating Community Partnership Documentation**: Gilead emphasizes "partnership with communities most directly impacted." Weak or missing letters of support from community organizations, social service providers, or patient communities will undermine credibility. Secure strong letters demonstrating genuine partnerships.

- **Ignoring Evaluation and Accountability**: Corporate foundations want measurable outcomes and data. Applications without clear evaluation plans, specific metrics, or data tracking mechanisms are less competitive. Emphasize Thrive's closed-loop referral tracking capability - this is a major differentiator.

- **Requesting Outside Typical Range**: While Gilead CAN award up to $100,000, typical awards are ~$50,000. Requesting significantly more without exceptional justification may reduce competitiveness. Target $40,000-$60,000 range unless project scope clearly justifies higher amount.

- **Overlooking Corporate Giving vs. Foundation Programs**: Gilead has separate corporate giving programs focused on therapeutic areas (HIV, liver disease, oncology) and the Gilead Foundation programs (Creating Possible, Building Community). Ensure you're applying to the right program - for SDOH/community health, Building Community is correct. For HIV-specific work in Florida, explore COMPASS Initiative connection.

- **Neglecting Sustainability**: One-year grants require clear plan for how SDOH screening and navigation continues after funding ends. Applications that don't address sustainability or rely entirely on continued Gilead funding are weaker. Emphasize integration into existing NHELP operations and Thrive platform infrastructure that outlasts grant period.

- **Weak Budget Justification**: Corporate foundations scrutinize budgets carefully. Every line item needs clear justification tied to project activities. Avoid padding or vague categories. Be specific about how each expense advances SDOH identification and intervention.
