## Research Concept

### PAR-24-231 Focus

**Community-Level Interventions to Reduce Health Disparities**

This FOA supports research on community-level interventions that:
- Partner with care providers and CHWs
- Address social determinants of health
- Implement evidence-based practices
- Focus on minority and underserved populations

### Proposed Study Design

**Title:** "AI-Powered SDOH Navigation to Reduce Health Disparities: A Community-Level Intervention"

**Research Question:** Does systematic SDOH screening and AI-powered navigation through mobile health reduce health disparities in chronic disease outcomes among Miami-Dade minority populations?

**Design:**
- Cluster-randomized trial
- Intervention: Thrive + CHW navigation
- Control: Standard community health services
- Primary outcomes: Chronic disease indicators
- Secondary: SDOH resolution, healthcare utilization

## Application Strategy

### Key Elements

1. **Implementation Science Framework** - Not basic research
2. **Community Partnership** - NHELP as genuine partner
3. **Health Disparities Lens** - Disaggregated outcomes
4. **CHW Integration** - Community health worker model
5. **Evaluation Rigor** - Strong research design

### Recommended Framing

> "This R01 proposes a community-level intervention leveraging AI-powered social determinants of health screening and navigation through NeighborhoodHELP's mobile health platform, with community health worker partnerships, to reduce chronic disease disparities among Miami-Dade's Hispanic and Black populations..."
