## Strategic Notes

1. **FIU-HDI Partnership Critical**: Leverage existing NIMHD relationship through FIU-HDI for credibility and collaboration opportunities

2. **Community-Level Interventions**: NIMHD strongly values community-engaged research - NHELP provides ideal community platform

3. **Implementation Science Preferred**: Frame proposals as implementation research rather than basic science - Thrive/NHELP as implementation vehicle

4. **Health Disparities Framework**: Use NIMHD Research Framework to structure proposals - must explicitly address disparity populations

5. **Multi-Level Interventions**: NIMHD prioritizes research that addresses multiple levels of determinants (individual, interpersonal, community, societal)
