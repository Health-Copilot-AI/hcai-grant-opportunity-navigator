# NIH NIMHD - Funder Deep Dive

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Focus**: Community-Level Interventions to Reduce Health Disparities
**Primary FOA**: PAR-24-231 (Expired May 2025) and successor opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

NIH NIMHD offers substantial research funding ($500K-$2M+ per project) for health disparities research. The primary opportunity (PAR-24-231) expired May 2025, but NIMHD continues funding similar research through parent R01 mechanisms and new FOAs. FIU has a **strong existing relationship** through FIU-HDI's NIMHD S21 award, providing significant credibility.

**Strategic Recommendation**: Monitor for successor FOAs while preparing R01 application using parent R01 mechanism with health disparities focus.

## Current & Successor Opportunities

### Status as of February 2026

PAR-24-231 expired May 2025. Current options for similar research:

| Option | Mechanism | Status | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Parent R01 | PA-20-185 | Active | Health disparities focus allowed |
| NIMHD-specific FOAs | Various | Monitor | Check NIMHD website regularly |
| Multi-Institute FOAs | Various | Monitor | Often include NIMHD participation |

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Immediate**: Submit through Parent R01 mechanism with explicit NIMHD targeting
2. **Short-term**: Monitor NIH Guide for successor to PAR-24-231
3. **Long-term**: Engage NIMHD program officers for guidance on upcoming opportunities

### Parent R01 Approach

When using Parent R01 for health disparities research:
- Select NIMHD as primary institute during submission
- Explicitly align with NIMHD strategic priorities
- Reference NIMHD Research Framework in proposal
- Contact NIMHD program officer pre-submission
