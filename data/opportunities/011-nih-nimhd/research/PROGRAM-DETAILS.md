## Special Requirements for Community Research

### NIMHD-Specific Expectations

For community-level intervention research:

1. **Health Disparity Population Focus**
   - Must explicitly target NIH-designated populations
   - Disaggregate outcomes by race/ethnicity, SES
   - Address structural determinants

2. **Community Partnership**
   - Community partners must be key personnel
   - Compensation for community partner effort
   - Letters demonstrating authentic partnership
   - Community involvement in research design

3. **Multi-Level Framework**
   - Use NIMHD Research Framework
   - Address multiple levels of influence
   - Include community-level data collection
   - Multi-level statistical analysis

4. **Intervention Design**
   - Community-level (not just individual)
   - Evidence-based or theory-driven
   - Culturally appropriate
   - Sustainable beyond grant period
