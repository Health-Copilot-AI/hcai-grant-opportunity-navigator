## Pre-Application Requirements

### Pillar Alignment Verification

- [ ] **Confirm which pillar aligns with proposed project**:
  - [ ] **Water** - Clean water access in rural Africa (Guinea, Zambia) - *LOW FIT for FIU*
  - [ ] **Education** - Disadvantaged/first-generation students, degree/certification programs - *MODERATE FIT*
  - [ ] **Healthcare** - Underserved populations (developing countries priority), cancer research - *MODERATE FIT with caveats*

- [ ] **Review pillar-specific expectations**:
  - Healthcare: Primarily developing country focus OR cancer research (Prostate Cancer Foundation model)
  - Education: Direct student support, financial/academic barrier removal
  - Water: Rural Africa infrastructure (not applicable to FIU)

### Eligibility Verification

- [ ] Confirm 501(c)(3) determination letter is current (FIU Foundation)
- [ ] Verify no other applications submitted to AJA Foundation in past 12 months
- [ ] Confirm no prior declination within last 12 months
- [ ] Verify organizational mission aligns with structural/systemic change approach (not just direct service)
- [ ] Confirm project demonstrates cost-effectiveness and proven results

### Strategic Assessment

- [ ] **Identify FIU's competitive advantage** - What makes this request compelling vs. other applicants?
- [ ] **Define structural barrier being addressed** - AJA prioritizes root causes over direct service
- [ ] **Determine measurement approach** - AJA emphasizes proven results and narrow missions
- [ ] **Assess geographic fit** - Does project align with AJA's funded states/cities? (Currently: AL, CA, CT, HI, ME, MA, NV, NY, TX, VA)

### Internal Approvals

- [ ] Department/unit approval obtained
- [ ] Office of Research notified (FIU HWCOM)
- [ ] Strategic decision: Is this the right time/concept given one-per-year limit?
- [ ] Review of AJA's recent grantees for similar programs (avoid duplication)
- [ ] Confirmation that project fits "narrow mission, cost-effective, proven results" criteria

---

## LOI (Letter of Inquiry) Requirements

- [ ] **Highlight cost-effectiveness**: $ per beneficiary, efficiency metrics
- [ ] **Demonstrate proven results**: Track record, data, prior success
- [ ] **Show narrow mission focus**: Specific, defined scope
- [ ] **Connect to founder's values**: Access for those who "have done everything society asks"

### LOI Key Messaging (Healthcare Pillar - Most Relevant for FIU)

- [ ] Frame as **healthcare access barrier identification** (FIU Thrive SDOH screening)
- [ ] Emphasize **underserved population focus** (Miami-Dade low-income communities)
- [ ] Position as **systems-level intervention** (not individual service)
- [ ] Highlight **cost per patient** efficiency metrics
- [ ] Connect to **health equity** (essential human right theme)
- [ ] Note **measurement infrastructure** (data-driven outcomes)

### LOI Red Flags to Avoid

- [ ] Avoid appearing to be direct service provider only
- [ ] Don't request amount exceeding typical grant range ($10K-$500K, average ~$100K)
- [ ] Don't span multiple pillars - choose one and align tightly

## Key Messaging Points

- **Pillar Alignment**: "This project directly addresses AJA's Healthcare pillar by delivering fundamental healthcare access to underserved populations through systematic identification and removal of structural barriers."

- **Structural Change Focus**: "FIU Thrive goes beyond treating individual patients - it identifies and addresses the structural barriers (housing insecurity, food insecurity, transportation) that prevent entire communities from accessing healthcare."

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: "At $[X] cost per patient screened and $[Y] cost per barrier addressed, this represents a highly efficient model for improving healthcare access at scale."

- **Proven Results**: "With [X] patients served, [Y]% improvement in [metric], and [Z] documented barrier resolutions, FIU Thrive has demonstrated measurable impact in Miami-Dade's most underserved communities."

- **Narrow Mission**: "This project has a singular focus: using data-driven SDOH screening to systematically connect low-income patients with resources that remove barriers to healthcare access."

- **Capable Leadership**: "Led by [PI name and credentials], FIU Thrive is backed by the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine's commitment to serving underserved populations and the proven track record of NeighborhoodHELP."

- **Founder Values Alignment**: "Like AJA's mission to help those for whom 'access to fundamental resources...remains structurally impossible,' FIU Thrive identifies the invisible barriers preventing patients who do everything right from accessing the healthcare they need."

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas

**Healthcare Pillar (Primary Recommendation)**:
- SDOH screening as structural barrier identification
- Healthcare access for underserved Miami-Dade populations
- Systems-level intervention (not direct medical care)
- Data-driven approach to equity

**Education Pillar (Alternative if Healthcare Doesn't Fit)**:
- Health literacy programs for first-generation college students
- Patient navigation training for disadvantaged students
- Medical education pipeline for underserved communities

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **"Structural Barrier Identification & Resolution Initiative"**: Deploy FIU Thrive's SDOH screening across [X] clinics serving low-income Miami-Dade populations to systematically identify and address the structural barriers (housing, food, transportation) preventing healthcare access. Cost-effective, data-driven, proven approach.

2. **"Health Equity Through Systems Change"**: Use FIU Thrive's comprehensive SDOH data to identify systemic gaps in Miami-Dade's safety net, enabling targeted policy and programmatic interventions that address root causes of healthcare access disparities.

3. **"Community Health Worker Barrier Resolution Program"**: Train and deploy community health workers using FIU Thrive's SDOH data to connect patients with resources addressing structural barriers, creating sustainable pathway from identification to resolution.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Data Infrastructure**: Most healthcare access programs lack systematic barrier identification - FIU Thrive screens every patient
- **Academic-Community Partnership**: Unique combination of medical school rigor and community-embedded delivery
- **Proven Track Record**: Unlike theoretical models, FIU Thrive has demonstrated results with real patients
- **Scalability**: Technology-enabled approach can expand efficiently
- **Structural Focus**: Explicitly addresses root causes, not symptoms

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Multi-Pillar Confusion**: Don't try to appeal to multiple pillars. Choose Healthcare (most relevant for FIU) and align tightly.

- **Direct Service Framing**: AJA emphasizes structural change, not just service provision. Avoid framing FIU Thrive as "we provide medical care" - frame as "we identify and remove barriers to care."

- **Ignoring One-Per-Year Limit**: Submitting prematurely with a weak concept wastes the annual opportunity. Take time to get it right.

- **Lack of Cost-Effectiveness Data**: AJA explicitly prioritizes "cost-effective solutions." Must include cost per patient, cost per barrier addressed, etc.

- **Missing Proven Results**: AJA wants track record. Don't submit if FIU Thrive lacks demonstrable outcomes data.

- **Wrong Geographic Emphasis**: AJA's Healthcare pillar favors developing countries OR cancer research domestically. Need to position Miami-Dade underserved populations as analogous to "healthcare deserts" in developing world.

- **Weak Sustainability Plan**: AJA wants long-term impact. Must show how structural changes persist beyond grant period.

- **Overly Complex/Broad Mission**: AJA prefers "narrow missions" - keep scope focused and specific.

- **University Overhead Red Flags**: High F&A rates may concern AJA. Consider cost-sharing or reduced rates.

- **Passive Language**: Use active voice showing agency and capability (matching AJA's emphasis on "capable and committed individuals").
