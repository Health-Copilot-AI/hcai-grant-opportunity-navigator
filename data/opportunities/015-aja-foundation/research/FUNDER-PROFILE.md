## Mission Statement

> "AJA Foundation seeks to help those who have done everything society asks of them, yet for whom access to fundamental resources and advancement remains elusive at best and structurally impossible at worst."

The foundation is driven by the belief that everyone deserves the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. They focus on providing access globally to clean water, affordable healthcare, and quality childhood education - viewing these as essential human rights that must be equitably distributed, not skewed toward wealth and privilege.

## Founder's Story

Andy Astrachan established the AJA Foundation in 2004. Three formative experiences shaped the foundation's three philanthropic pillars:

1. **Education Pillar**: An invitation by the principal of 112th Street Elementary School in South Central Los Angeles to mentor students and help the school obtain resources
2. **Water Pillar**: A trip to Africa to participate in digging a water well in a remote rural village (specifically, Mfuwe, Zambia in 2009 to restore a collapsed well serving 300 people)
3. **Healthcare Pillar**: His own cancer diagnosis, which led to involvement with the Prostate Cancer Foundation

In 2014, Andy was elected to the Board of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and was a driving force behind "Many vs. Cancer."

## Strategic Considerations for Applicants

### Strong Fit Indicators
- Structural/systemic approach to problems (not just direct service)
- Focus on root causes of inequity
- Measurable outcomes and proven track record
- Cost-effective delivery model
- Geographic alignment (U.S. education, developing world water/healthcare)

### Alignment with FIU Programs

| Program | Alignment Assessment |
|---------|---------------------|
| **FIU Thrive** | Moderate - SDOH screening addresses structural barriers to healthcare access |
| **NeighborhoodHELP** | Moderate - Community health model, but primarily U.S.-focused vs. AJA's developing world healthcare focus |

### Potential Framing Approaches
1. **Structural Barriers**: Position FIU Thrive as systematically identifying and addressing structural barriers to healthcare access
2. **Root Cause Focus**: Emphasize how SDOH data enables targeted interventions at systemic level
3. **Education-Health Nexus**: Frame health literacy and patient navigation as education access issue

### Challenges for FIU
- Healthcare pillar primarily focused on developing countries
- Domestic healthcare focus is cancer research (Prostate Cancer Foundation)
- No obvious history of funding university-based programs
- May need to emphasize how community health work addresses structural inequities
