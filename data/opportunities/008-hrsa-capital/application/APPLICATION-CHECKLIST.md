## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas (Based on HRSA Priorities)

1. **Expanding Primary Care Access in MUA/MUPs**: Mobile health units serving designated medically underserved areas in Miami-Dade County
2. **Integrated Behavioral Health Services**: Mental health and substance use disorder treatment integrated with primary care
3. **Social Determinants of Health**: Enabling services addressing housing, food security, transportation barriers
4. **Health Disparities Reduction**: Targeted services for uninsured, underinsured, communities of color
5. **Chronic Disease Management**: Hypertension, diabetes care in underserved communities (aligns with NHCI-HC if available)

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **NeighborhoodHELP Mobile Health Center Expansion**: Establish 2-3 new permanent mobile service sites in MUA-designated neighborhoods, providing comprehensive primary care, behavioral health, and enabling services to uninsured residents. Partner with existing FQHC for H80 eligibility and sustainability.

2. **Integrated Behavioral Health Mobile Units**: Deploy specialized mobile units providing co-located primary care and behavioral health services (mental health + substance use disorder treatment) addressing critical access gaps in underserved Miami-Dade communities.

3. **Academic Health Center Partnership Model**: Create innovative partnership between FIU HWCOM and established FQHC, leveraging medical education mission to staff mobile health services while expanding health center service capacity in designated underserved areas.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **Academic Medical Center Distinction**: Position as only academic medical center in region proposing mobile health center model, combining clinical excellence with medical education and research missions.

- **Established Mobile Infrastructure**: Leverage existing NeighborhoodHELP operational experience - not starting from zero, but scaling proven model.

- **Medical Education Integration**: Provide clinical training sites for future primary care workforce, addressing national health workforce shortage while delivering community services.

- **Technology-Enabled Care**: Emphasize health IT infrastructure, telehealth capabilities, and data systems supporting UDS reporting excellence.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Registration Errors

- **Late Registration**: Waiting until NOFO release to start SAM.gov registration - process takes 4+ weeks
- **Mismatched Information**: Organization name, address, EIN not matching exactly across SAM.gov, Grants.gov, EHBs
- **Expired SAM.gov**: SAM.gov registration expires annually - check status well before deadline
- **Missing 9-Digit ZIP**: Using 5-digit ZIP codes instead of required 9-digit ZIP+4 format

### Application Content Errors

- **Ignoring Page Limits**: Exceeding narrative page limits results in pages being removed before review
- **Missing Required Sections**: Not addressing all NOFO-required sections in narrative
- **Inconsistent Data**: Services in Form 5A not matching sites in Form 5B
- **Weak Needs Assessment**: Failing to document MUA/MUP designation or community health needs data
- **No Sustainability Plan**: Not demonstrating clear path to financial viability beyond federal funding
- **Missing Consumer Majority**: Not ensuring 51% consumer representation on board governance

### Budget Errors

- **Unallowable Costs**: Including construction costs in operating grants, or operating costs in capital grants
- **Insufficient Justification**: Not explaining why each cost is necessary and how calculated
- **Incorrect Indirect Rate**: Using wrong rate or wrong cost base for indirect costs
- **Missing Match Documentation**: Not documenting required cost share or match (if applicable)

### Partnership Errors

- **No H80 Partnership**: Applying for Capital Development or SAC without existing health center status or partnership
- **Weak Letters of Support**: Generic letters not specific to project or community need
- **Unsigned MOUs**: Partnership agreements not signed by authorized representatives
- **Missing Form 8 Agreements**: Not documenting required hospital/specialty care arrangements

### Submission Errors

- **Last Minute Submission**: Submitting at deadline without time to fix technical problems
- **Wrong Deadline Time**: Confusing Phase 1 (11:59 PM) vs Phase 2 (5:00 PM) deadlines
- **Missing Confirmation**: Not saving submission confirmation receipts
- **Phase 2 Oversight**: Submitting Phase 1 but forgetting Phase 2 is required

### Technical Errors

- **Large File Sizes**: Exceeding Grants.gov file size limits for attachments
- **Wrong File Formats**: Using non-compliant file formats (use PDF for most attachments)
- **Incomplete Validation**: Not running and fixing all validation errors before submission
- **Browser Compatibility**: Using incompatible browser for EHBs submission
