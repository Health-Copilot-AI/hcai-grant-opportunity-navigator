## Strategic Notes

### 1. Eligibility Pathway: Partnership vs. Direct Application

**Key Insight**: Most BPHC programs require current H80 health center status, which FIU programs do not hold. The most expedient pathway is partnership with an existing FQHC rather than pursuing Look-Alike designation (12-18 month process) or new H80 application (highly competitive).

**Recommendation**: Identify Miami-Dade FQHCs with mobile health or expansion interests. Position NeighborhoodHELP as turnkey mobile health infrastructure and FIU as academic partner providing workforce, quality improvement, and clinical expertise. FQHC serves as lead applicant; FIU as subcontractor/partner.

### 2. Capital Development Sweet Spot: Mobile Medical Units

**Key Insight**: Capital Development grants explicitly support mobile medical units, and BPHC prioritizes access expansion in underserved areas. NeighborhoodHELP's existing mobile health program directly aligns with this priority. Mobile units are one of the few vehicle purchases allowed under federal health center grants.

**Recommendation**: Position NeighborhoodHELP mobile unit expansion as capital development project. Partner FQHC applies for equipment grant ($50K-$200K for medical equipment) or full mobile unit capital grant ($500K-$750K for vehicle, equipment, and minor build-out). Demonstrate how mobile services extend FQHC service area into new MUA/MUP communities.

### 3. Timing Strategy: Multi-Year Planning Horizon

**Key Insight**: FY 2026 SAC deadlines (October/November 2025) have passed. Capital Development NOFOs are released periodically, not on fixed annual cycles. NAP typically releases August/October timeframe.

**Recommendation**: Use FY 2026-2027 period for partnership development, Look-Alike exploration (if pursuing direct eligibility), and MUA/MUP documentation. Monitor Grants.gov weekly for Capital Development NOFOs. Prepare for NAP FY 2027 cycle (likely August/October 2026 deadlines) if pursuing new access point strategy.

### 4. Service Area Documentation: Proactive Data Assembly

**Key Insight**: All BPHC applications require comprehensive service area documentation including MUA/MUP designation evidence, community health needs assessment, census data, and health indicator statistics. This data assembly process takes 3-6 months.

**Recommendation**: Immediately access HRSA Data Warehouse (data.hrsa.gov) to verify Miami-Dade MUA/MUP designations for NeighborhoodHELP service areas. Compile 3-year patient encounter data, demographic profiles, and health outcomes. Create GIS maps showing service sites relative to underserved populations. This documentation will be required for any BPHC application regardless of program.

### 5. Academic Medical Center Value Proposition

**Key Insight**: BPHC increasingly values partnerships that integrate academic medical centers for workforce development, residency training, quality improvement infrastructure, and research capacity. FIU's status as medical school is differentiator but must be framed correctly.

**Recommendation**: Frame FIU/NeighborhoodHELP partnership proposals emphasizing: (1) residency/student clinical training rotations in underserved settings, (2) quality improvement and PCMH implementation support, (3) data analytics and performance measurement capacity, (4) chronic disease management protocols based on evidence-based medicine, (5) behavioral health integration expertise. Position as "academic-community partnership model" aligned with HRSA's workforce development and quality priorities.

### 6. 4-Year Sustainability Requirement

**Key Insight**: BPHC now emphasizes 4-year performance periods and requires demonstration of financial sustainability beyond initial grant funding. Applications must show viable payer mix, revenue diversification, and operational efficiency.

**Recommendation**: Develop pro forma financial projections showing transition from grant support to sustainable operations through: (1) Medicaid/Medicare enrollment and billing, (2) FQHC prospective payment system (PPS) rates if applicable, (3) 340B drug pricing program participation, (4) sliding fee scale revenue, (5) state/local government support, (6) private foundation diversification. For capital grants, show how new infrastructure enables increased patient volume and revenue generation.

### 7. Health Center Look-Alike Pathway

**Key Insight**: Health Center Look-Alike status provides BPHC program eligibility without operational grant funding. Look-Alikes receive FQHC billing rates, 340B access, and FTCA malpractice coverage but must meet all Section 330 requirements. Application process takes 12-18 months.

**Recommendation**: If FIU intends long-term BPHC engagement beyond partnership model, initiate Look-Alike application process. Requires: (1) Consumer majority governing board establishment, (2) Sliding fee scale implementation, (3) Comprehensive service provision (medical, dental, behavioral, enabling), (4) Quarterly performance reporting systems, (5) PCMH recognition pursuit. Look-Alike status enables direct NAP and capital grant eligibility.

### 8. Miami-Dade FQHC Landscape

**Key Insight**: Miami-Dade County has multiple established FQHCs with existing HRSA funding, infrastructure, and compliance systems. Partnership opportunities exist but require understanding of each organization's strategic priorities and capacity.

**Potential Partners for Exploration**:
- **Community Health of South Florida**: Large FQHC network with multiple sites
- **Jessie Trice Community Health System**: Historic FQHC serving underserved communities
- **Caridad Health Clinic**: Faith-based FQHC with migrant health focus
- **Sunshine Health Center**: Behavioral health integration emphasis
- **Borinquen Health Care Center**: Culturally specific services

**Recommendation**: Conduct partnership feasibility assessment with each organization. Evaluate alignment on mobile health strategy, service area expansion priorities, and academic partnership interest. Identify FQHC with strategic plan including mobile services or new access points where NeighborhoodHELP can provide implementation capacity.

### 9. Compliance and Regulatory Infrastructure

**Key Insight**: BPHC programs require significant compliance infrastructure including Section 330 requirements, HRSA EHBs reporting, Uniform Data System (UDS) submissions, site visits, and ongoing monitoring. This is not grant administration as typical of foundation grants but operational compliance as condition of award.

**Recommendation**: If pursuing BPHC funding (directly or via partnership), invest in grant compliance infrastructure: (1) Dedicated BPHC program manager with health center experience, (2) EHBs system training and account management, (3) UDS reporting systems and data validation processes, (4) Quality improvement plan and PCMH preparation, (5) Federal procurement compliance (required for capital projects). Partner selection should prioritize FQHCs with strong compliance track record (check HRSA site visit findings).

### 10. Congressional Appropriations Risk

**Key Insight**: Unlike foundation endowments, BPHC funding depends on annual Congressional appropriations. FY 2026 saw modest increases, but political dynamics create funding uncertainty. President's FY 2026 proposal initially suggested HRSA restructuring and cuts (rejected by Congress).

**Recommendation**: Treat BPHC funding as one component of diversified funding strategy, not sole source. Monitor Congressional appropriations cycles (typically September/October) and HRSA advocacy communications. Engage with National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) advocacy efforts. Build relationships with Florida Congressional delegation offices (particularly House and Senate appropriations committee members) to support health center funding.

## Strategic Alignment with FIU Programs

### NeighborhoodHELP Alignment Analysis

| HRSA Priority | NeighborhoodHELP Capability | Alignment Strength | Grant Program Fit |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mobile Health Services** | Operational mobile medical units serving underserved Miami-Dade communities | **STRONG** | Capital Development (mobile units), NAP (new access points) |
| **Medically Underserved Areas** | Service areas in high-poverty, low-access neighborhoods | **STRONG** | All BPHC programs (requires MUA/MUP documentation) |
| **Primary Care Access** | Medical, screening, preventive care delivery | **STRONG** | NAP, SAC (via partnership) |
| **Vulnerable Populations** | Uninsured, underinsured, communities of color | **STRONG** | Core BPHC mission alignment |
| **Comprehensive Services** | Medical services provided; dental/behavioral health limited | **MODERATE** | Would need partnership/expansion for comprehensive requirement |
| **Sliding Fee Scale** | Current fee structure not FQHC-compliant | **WEAK** | Would require restructuring or partnership |
| **Governance (Consumer Board)** | Academic medical center governance model | **WEAK** | Would require new governance structure or partnership |

**Overall Assessment**: NeighborhoodHELP has strong programmatic alignment with BPHC mission and priorities, particularly for mobile health capital development and access expansion. Primary barriers are structural (lack of H80 status, governance requirements, comprehensive services) rather than mission misalignment. Partnership pathway most viable for near-term opportunities; Look-Alike pathway for long-term direct eligibility.

### FIU Thrive Alignment Analysis

| HRSA Priority | FIU Thrive Capability | Alignment Strength | Grant Program Fit |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Community-Based Primary Care** | If Thrive includes clinical services in community settings | **MODERATE** | NAP (if expanding to new sites), SAC (via partnership) |
| **Chronic Disease Management** | Chronic condition focus and care coordination | **STRONG** | Health center program emphasis on diabetes, hypertension |
| **Social Determinants of Health** | Holistic approach addressing non-medical barriers | **STRONG** | BPHC enabling services, care coordination priorities |
| **Academic Integration** | Medical school-based initiative | **STRONG** | Workforce development, quality improvement partnership value |
| **Behavioral Health Integration** | Depends on Thrive program scope | **VARIABLE** | Critical BPHC priority if Thrive includes mental health/SUD |

**Overall Assessment**: FIU Thrive alignment depends on specific program scope (requires further documentation review). If Thrive includes clinical primary care services in community settings, NAP or partnership opportunities exist. If Thrive is primarily care coordination/case management without direct clinical services, BPHC fit is weaker. Academic medical center integration is strength for partnership proposals.

### Combined FIU Strategy Recommendations

1. **Immediate (2026)**: Initiate partnership discussions with Miami-Dade FQHCs regarding mobile health expansion or new access points leveraging NeighborhoodHELP infrastructure
2. **Near-Term (2026-2027)**: Document NeighborhoodHELP service area MUA/MUP status, compile patient data, prepare capital development grant materials for FQHC-led application
3. **Medium-Term (2027-2028)**: Evaluate Look-Alike pathway feasibility if direct BPHC eligibility desired; alternatively, strengthen FQHC partnership model
4. **Long-Term (2028+)**: Consider H80 health center application if sustainable operational model developed with comprehensive services (medical, dental, behavioral, enabling)
