## Patient Engagement Philosophy

### Six Foundational Expectations for Partnerships in Research

PCORI requires meaningful patient and stakeholder engagement through six foundational expectations (updated from the 2014 Engagement Rubric):

| # | Expectation | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Representative Involvement** | Include partners, organizations, researchers, and team members who reflect the range of patients and communities affected by the research topic |
| 2 | **Early & Ongoing Engagement** | Ensure partners contribute early and throughout the study, including planning, conducting, and disseminating results |
| 3 | **Dedicated Funds for Engagement & Partner Compensation** | Budget for engagement activities and compensate partners for their time, expertise, and perspectives |
| 4 | **Build Capacity to Work as a Team** | Identify skills, strengths, and barriers; provide information, training, and support for collaborative work |
| 5 | **Meaningful Inclusion of Partners in Decision Making** | Implement structures and processes that include partners in decision making throughout all project phases |
| 6 | **Ongoing Review & Assessment of Engagement** | Gather input and feedback throughout the project to identify improvements and adjust approaches as needed |

### Definition of Meaningful Engagement

**What qualifies:**
- Active partnership between researchers, patients, caregivers, clinicians, and other partners
- Engagement along a continuum: input → consultation → collaboration → shared leadership
- Partners involved in planning, conducting, and disseminating research

**What does NOT qualify:**
- Activities limited to requesting input only (surveys, focus groups alone)
- Token involvement without decision-making authority
- Late-stage consultation without ongoing engagement

### Patient Partners vs. Study Participants

**Patient Partners:**
- People with lived experience (patients, family members, caregivers, community members)
- Organizations representing the population of interest
- Involved in planning, conducting, and disseminating research
- Receive compensation for their contributions

**Study Participants:**
- Individuals enrolled in the research study
- Provide data through study procedures
- Not involved in research design or governance

### Non-Compliance Consequences

Studies that:
- Do not meaningfully engage patients and other partners
- Propose only input approaches to engagement

**Will be deemed nonresponsive** and not considered for funding.

## Research Infrastructure: PCORnet

### Overview

**PCORnet** (National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network) is PCORI's national research infrastructure resource enhancing capacity for patient-centered research.

### Components

- **Clinical Research Networks (CRNs):** Healthcare system-based research networks
- **Common Data Model:** Standardized data structure enabling multi-site research
- **National Scale Capability:** Infrastructure for large-scale observational studies and pragmatic trials

### Category 3 Requirements (Broad Pragmatic Studies)

For PCORnet-based Category 3 awards:
- Must utilize PCORnet's clinical research infrastructure
