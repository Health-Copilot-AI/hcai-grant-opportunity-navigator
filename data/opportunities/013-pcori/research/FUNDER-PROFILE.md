## Strategic Alignment with FIU Programs

### NeighborhoodHELP Alignment

**Strengths:**
- Community-driven model with CHWs aligns with PCORI's patient engagement requirements
- Service to underserved Miami-Dade populations addresses health equity priority
- Mobile health delivery platform creates real-world pragmatic study setting
- Existing community partnerships provide ready-made stakeholder base
- Track record of patient-centered care delivery

**Potential Study Concepts:**
1. **CHW Navigation Models**: Compare different CHW training levels, functions, or integration approaches
2. **SDOH Screening Implementation**: Compare FIU Thrive-enhanced vs. standard SDOH screening
3. **Closed-Loop Referral Systems**: Compare technology-enabled vs. manual referral tracking
4. **Care Coordination Interventions**: Compare different models of care coordination for patients with multiple chronic conditions

### FIU Thrive Alignment

**Strengths:**
- AI-enhanced SDOH screening aligns with PCORI's AI/ML methods priority
- Platform generates comparative effectiveness data (enhanced vs. standard screening)
- Technology enables scalable, pragmatic implementation
- Patient-centered design with focus on actionable outcomes
- Potential for health equity impact through improved SDOH identification

**Potential Study Concepts:**
1. **AI/ML Methods Development**: Validate FIU Thrive algorithms for SDOH identification accuracy
2. **Comparative Effectiveness Trial**: Thrive-enhanced care vs. standard SDOH screening and referral
3. **Implementation Study**: Different strategies for integrating Thrive into clinical workflows
4. **Patient-Reported Outcomes**: Compare patient satisfaction and experience with AI-enhanced vs. standard screening

### Recommended Entry Strategy

**Phase 1 (2026): Capacity Building**
- **Program**: Engagement Award (Capacity Building)
- **Amount**: $250,000-$300,000
- **Duration**: 2 years
- **Purpose**:
  - Establish patient advisory board from NeighborhoodHELP service population
  - Build capacity for patient-centered research
  - Develop relationships with PCORI program officers
  - Pilot engagement approaches for future research proposals

**Phase 2 (2027): Methods Development**
- **Program**: Methods PFA (AI/ML)
- **Amount**: $500,000-$750,000
- **Duration**: 3 years
- **Purpose**:
  - Validate FIU Thrive AI/ML algorithms
  - Develop patient-centered implementation approaches
  - Build evidence base for larger pragmatic trial
  - Publish methodology papers establishing credibility

**Phase 3 (2028-2032): Pragmatic Trial**
- **Program**: Broad Pragmatic Studies (Category 1 or 2)
- **Amount**: $5M-$12M
- **Duration**: 5 years
- **Purpose**:
  - Compare FIU Thrive-enhanced care vs. standard care
  - Multi-site implementation across Miami-Dade safety-net settings
  - Patient-centered outcomes (SDOH needs addressed, health service utilization, patient satisfaction)
  - Dissemination and implementation planning

**Total Potential PCORI Investment**: $5.75M - $13.05M over 7 years

### Risk Mitigation

**Key Challenges:**
- High competition (6-12% overall success rate)
- Extensive patient engagement infrastructure required
- 12-18 month application timeline
- Rigorous methodology standards compliance
- No prior PCORI relationship

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with Engagement Award to build capacity and relationship
- Engage PCORI program officers early for guidance
- Leverage NeighborhoodHELP's existing community partnerships
- Invest in patient advisory board development before LOI
- Partner with institution with prior PCORI success (e.g., UF Health)
- Consider consortium approach for larger applications

## Strategic Notes

1. **Patient Engagement is Non-Negotiable**: PCORI's Six Foundational Expectations are strict requirements, not aspirational goals. Applications without genuine patient engagement throughout all phases will be rejected. FIU must establish a patient advisory board before LOI submission, budget adequately for partner compensation, and demonstrate meaningful decision-making roles for patient partners.

2. **Engagement Award as Strategic Entry Point**: The Capacity Building Engagement Award ($100K-$300K) represents an ideal low-risk entry to PCORI funding. This program would support establishment of a patient advisory board, build organizational capacity for patient-centered research, and create a relationship with PCORI program officers. Success here positions FIU for larger research awards.

3. **AI/ML Methods Priority Creates Timely Opportunity**: PCORI's 2026 Methods PFA specifically prioritizes AI/ML applications in CER, directly aligning with FIU Thrive's technology. A methods development award ($500K-$750K) focused on validating Thrive's algorithms would build evidence and credibility before pursuing a larger pragmatic trial.

4. **Comparative Design is Required**: All PCORI research must compare two or more interventions/approaches. FIU Thrive vs. standard SDOH screening creates a natural comparative framework. The key is demonstrating both approaches are clinically legitimate comparators and the choice between them represents genuine uncertainty.

5. **Health Equity Lens Strengthens Competitiveness**: PCORI's National Priority to Achieve Health Equity permeates all funding decisions. NeighborhoodHELP's focus on underserved Miami-Dade communities positions FIU well, but applications must explicitly frame research through health equity lens with measurable disparities outcomes.

6. **Timeline Requires 18+ Month Lead Time**: The two-stage process (LOI then full application) plus 3-4 month review cycle means 12-18 months from initial LOI to award. For Cycle 2 2026 (LOI deadline April 28, 2026), FIU needs to begin preparation immediately to meet deadline.

7. **Methodology Standards Compliance is Complex**: PCORI's 67 methodology standards across 17 areas create significant compliance burden. FIU should engage biostatistician and methodologist early to ensure study design meets applicable standards. The Methodology Standards Checklist is required with full application.

8. **Patient-Centered Outcomes Must Be Primary**: Unlike NIH where clinical outcomes are primary, PCORI requires patient-important outcomes as primary endpoints. For FIU Thrive, this means outcomes like "number of SDOH needs successfully addressed" or "patient satisfaction with care coordination," not just clinical metrics.

9. **Relationship Building with Program Officers**: PCORI encourages applicants to contact program staff before LOI submission. This isn't optional advice—it's essential strategy. Program officers can provide feedback on concept fit, suggest relevant portfolio studies, and guide methodology approach. Contact pfa@pcori.org to request consultation.

10. **Multi-Institution Partnerships Strengthen Applications**: While not required, partnerships with organizations that have prior PCORI success increase competitiveness. Consider partnering with University of Florida Health (HSII participant) or other Florida institutions with PCORI portfolio presence.
