## Research Concept

### Proposed Study Design

**Title:** "Comparative Effectiveness of AI-Enhanced SDOH Screening and Navigation vs. Standard Care in Underserved Communities"

**Primary Question:** Does FIU Thrive-enhanced SDOH screening and closed-loop referral improve patient-centered outcomes compared to standard community health center care?

**Study Arms:**
1. **Intervention:** FIU Thrive + CHW navigation + closed-loop referrals
2. **Control:** Standard SDOH screening and referral processes

**Outcomes:**
- Primary: SDOH needs addressed at 6 months
- Secondary: Health service utilization, patient satisfaction, health status

## Application Strategy

### Key Elements

1. **Patient Advisory Board:** Establish community advisory with patient representatives
2. **Comparative Framework:** Clear intervention vs. control design
3. **Health Equity Lens:** Frame around disparities reduction
4. **Pragmatic Design:** Real-world implementation focus
5. **CHW Integration:** Community health worker partnerships

### Recommended Framing

> "This patient-centered comparative effectiveness study will evaluate whether AI-powered social determinants of health screening and navigation through FIU Thrive, delivered via the NeighborhoodHELP mobile health program, improves patient-centered outcomes compared to standard community health center practices in Miami-Dade County's underserved communities..."
