## Proposed Research Concept

### Title
"Comparative Effectiveness of AI-Enhanced SDOH Screening and Navigation vs. Standard Care in Underserved Communities"

### Research Question
Does FIU Thrive-enhanced SDOH screening and closed-loop referral improve patient-centered outcomes compared to standard community health center care?

### Study Arms
1. **Intervention:** FIU Thrive + CHW navigation + closed-loop referrals
2. **Control:** Standard SDOH screening and referral processes

### Outcomes
- **Primary:** SDOH needs addressed at 6 months
- **Secondary:** Health service utilization, patient satisfaction, health status

---

## Key Messaging Points

- **Patient-Centered**: Research question must matter to patients, not just clinicians
- **Comparative Effectiveness**: Must compare two or more approaches
- **Health Equity**: PCORI prioritizes research addressing disparities
- **Real-World Implementation**: Pragmatic design in actual practice settings
- **Meaningful Engagement**: Patient partners are co-investigators, not just subjects
- **Actionable Results**: Research must lead to practice change decisions

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Weak Patient Engagement** - Token involvement is not acceptable
2. **Not Comparative** - PCORI requires comparing interventions
3. **Clinical Focus Only** - Patient-centered outcomes required
4. **Late PAB Formation** - Should exist before LOI submission
5. **No Compensation Plan** - Patient partners must be compensated
6. **Missing Health Equity** - Must address equity advancement
7. **Last-Minute Submission** - Submit early for system issues
