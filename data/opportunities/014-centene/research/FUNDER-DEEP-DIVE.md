Since open applications are ending, organizations should:

   - Centene will retain information for future consideration

2. **Demonstrate Alignment**
   - Focus on healthcare, social services, or education
   - Show deep local community engagement
   - Emphasize potential for long-term collaboration

## Strategic Analysis for FIU/HCAI

### Relevance Assessment

| Social services integration | FIU Thrive comprehensive approach |
| Community health | Miami-Dade underserved populations |
| Long-term partnerships | Academic-community collaboration model |

### Florida Connection

**Sunshine Health** is Centene's Florida health plan subsidiary. This is the critical relationship for any Florida-based application.

### Key Considerations

1. **Invitation-Only Model (2026)**
   - Must establish relationship with Sunshine Health leadership
   - Open applications ending - urgency to connect

2. **Grant Size Potential**
   - Average: $235,885
   - Median: $67,000
   - Significant grants possible for strong partnerships

3. **Partnership Preference**
   - Centene favors multi-year, growing relationships
   - Aligns with academic research/training timelines
   - Opportunity for sustained funding vs. one-time grants

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Contact Sunshine Health (Florida Centene subsidiary) to introduce FIU HWCOM programs
2. **Position**: Emphasize SDOH focus, Medicaid population service, long-term partnership potential
3. **Prepare**: Document community health impact, outcome data for presentation
4. **Timeline**: Before 2026 transition to invitation-only model

### Potential Pitch Points

- NeighborhoodHELP serves Centene/Sunshine Health members in Miami-Dade
- FIU Thrive addresses SDOH comprehensively (food, housing, social services)
- Academic partnership offers workforce development (medical students, residents)
- Established community presence with measurable outcomes
