## Strategic Notes

1. **Invitation-Only Urgency**: With 2026 transition to invitation-only model, establishing relationship with Sunshine Health (Centene's Florida subsidiary) is **critical and time-sensitive**. Fall 2025 may represent final open application opportunity.

2. **Sunshine Health Connection**: Florida-based applications must emphasize alignment with Sunshine Health priorities and service to Medicaid populations in Miami-Dade County. Direct outreach to Sunshine Health leadership should precede any foundation application.

3. **Partnership Over Projects**: Centene explicitly favors long-term partnerships that grow over time. Application should propose multi-year vision with potential for expansion rather than single-year project. Frame initial grant as entry point to sustained collaboration.

4. **SDOH Comprehensive Approach**: FIU Thrive's integration of social determinant screening, navigation, and closed-loop referrals directly addresses Centene's priority areas (food, housing, transportation, social services). This is a strong differentiator.

5. **Medicaid ROI Potential**: Position NeighborhoodHELP as infrastructure serving Centene's customer base. Emphasize care coordination, preventive care access, emergency department diversion, and cost savings potential for Medicaid managed care plans.

6. **Academic Value-Add**: Highlight workforce development dimension (medical student/resident training in community health, SDOH screening) as unique benefit of academic partnership vs. traditional community health center grant.

7. **Data-Driven Outcomes**: Centene will expect robust evaluation and outcome reporting. FIU Thrive platform capabilities for data collection, tracking, and outcomes measurement should be prominently featured.

8. **Geographic Strategy**: While Centene operates nationally, Florida grants are feasible given Sunshine Health presence. Review prior Florida grants in 990-PF filings to identify precedent and successful applicant profiles.

9. **Grant Size Positioning**: Average grant is $235,885; median ~$67,000. Request should be calibrated to demonstrated organizational capacity and project scope. Modest initial request with expansion potential may be strategic.

10. **Event Sponsorship Alternative**: If formal grant application timeline doesn't align, event sponsorships are accepted year-round. Could be relationship-building vehicle (e.g., sponsor NeighborhoodHELP community health event to establish Centene connection).

## Florida-Specific Context

### Sunshine Health (Centene's Florida Subsidiary)

- **Service Area**: Statewide Florida Medicaid managed care
- **Relevance**: Critical relationship for any Florida-based Centene Foundation application
- **Strategy**: Contact Sunshine Health community engagement/corporate responsibility team to introduce FIU programs and explore partnership interest before formal foundation application

### Prior Florida Grants

Review of 990-PF filings needed to identify Florida recipients and grant characteristics. No Florida grants identified in 2023 sample data, but broader 990-PF review may reveal precedent.

### Miami-Dade Alignment

- NeighborhoodHELP serves Medicaid-eligible populations in Miami-Dade County
- Sunshine Health operates Medicaid plans in Miami-Dade
- Potential for direct impact on Centene member population
- Geographic alignment with Centene service area

## Related Entity Note

Centene operates a second foundation, **Centene Foundation For Quality Health Care** (EIN 20-1516497), which appears to have limited recent activity. All grant-seeking efforts should focus on **Centene Charitable Foundation** (EIN 20-1298192) as the active grantmaking entity.
