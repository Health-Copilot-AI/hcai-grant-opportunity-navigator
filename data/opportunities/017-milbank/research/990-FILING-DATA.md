## Financial Capacity Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Stable Asset Base**: $25 million endowment provides reliable annual giving capacity
2. **Low Administrative Costs**: Volunteer leadership minimizes overhead
3. **Consistent Giving Pattern**: Annual grants of $1.6-2.3 million over 5+ years
4. **Increasing Trend**: 2024 grantmaking exceeded $2.3 million

### Considerations

1. **Investment-Dependent**: Revenue fluctuates with market performance
2. **No Multi-Year Grants**: Single-year funding only
3. **Modest Grant Sizes**: Most grants range $10,000-$100,000
4. **Largest Grants Reserved**: $200,000-$500,000 grants typically go to established partners (Yale Cancer Center)
