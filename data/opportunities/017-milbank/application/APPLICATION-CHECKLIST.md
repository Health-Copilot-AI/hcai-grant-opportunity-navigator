---

## Key Messaging Points

- **Funder Priority Alignment**:
  - SENIORS/AGING IN PLACE: "NeighborhoodHELP delivers non-institutional, community-based health services that enable seniors to age in place in Miami-Dade County"
  - MENTAL HEALTH: "FIU Thrive integrates mental health screening into primary care, identifying at-risk individuals for early intervention"
  - DISABILITIES: "Community health workers connect individuals with disabilities to resources promoting independence and community integration"
  - VETERANS: "Miami-Dade has [X] veterans, many facing barriers to healthcare access; NHELP/Thrive serves this population through mobile care"

- **Community-Based Emphasis**:
  - Use language: "community-based," "non-institutional," "in-home," "neighborhood-level"
  - Avoid language: "clinic-based," "institutional," "facility," "medical center"

- **Independence and Empowerment**:
  - Frame services as enabling self-sufficiency and community integration
  - Emphasize consumer choice and person-centered care
  - Highlight pathways to independence

- **Measurable Outcomes**:
  - Quantify expected impact: number served, health outcomes improved, hospitalizations prevented
  - Use data from prior NeighborhoodHELP/Thrive work to establish credibility
  - Connect outputs to outcomes (not just service delivery numbers)

- **FIU Track Record**:
  - Leverage: HWCOM's 15+ years serving underserved communities in Miami-Dade
  - Highlight: NeighborhoodHELP's established community partnerships
  - Showcase: FIU Thrive's innovative screening technology (if relevant to project)

- **Sustainability Path**:
  - Milbank does NOT fund multi-year, so sustainability is critical
  - Articulate: Plan for continuing services through other funding, partnerships, or revenue
  - Demonstrate: How 12-month grant creates lasting impact or infrastructure

- **Innovation with Pragmatism**:
  - Balance novel approach with proven methodology
  - Show how project addresses gaps in current service system
  - Avoid overly ambitious or untested concepts for first grant

## Concept Development Suggestions

### Recommended Focus Areas for FIU/NeighborhoodHELP

**1. SENIORS AGING IN PLACE (Strongest Alignment)**
   - Expand NeighborhoodHELP services to high-need senior population
   - Mobile health screening + home-based follow-up
   - Connect isolated seniors to community resources
   - Fall prevention, medication management, chronic disease support
   - Expected grant range: $50,000-$100,000

**2. VETERAN HEALTH INTEGRATION**
   - Partner with VA Miami to reach disconnected veterans
   - Community health workers trained in veteran-specific needs
   - Address mental health, disability services, aging issues for veteran population
   - Expected grant range: $50,000-$75,000

**3. MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING & LINKAGE**
   - Deploy FIU Thrive screening in community settings
   - Focus on suicide prevention and early intervention
   - Train CHWs to recognize warning signs and connect to services
   - Youth mental health component (if serving young adults)
   - Expected grant range: $25,000-$75,000

### Potential Project Concepts

1. **"Aging in Place: Mobile Health for Miami Seniors"**: NeighborhoodHELP expands services to homebound seniors in [target neighborhoods], providing in-home health screenings, chronic disease management, and connections to community resources that enable independent living. Project serves 200 seniors over 12 months with measurable outcomes in hospital utilization reduction and care coordination.

2. **"Veteran Wellness Initiative"**: Community health worker program specifically designed for Miami-Dade veterans, addressing barriers to healthcare access, mental health needs, and disability services. Partnership with VA Miami Healthcare System and local veteran service organizations ensures comprehensive support and sustainable referral pathways.

3. **"Mental Health First Response"**: Integrate FIU Thrive mental health screening into NeighborhoodHELP community outreach, train CHWs in crisis intervention and resource navigation, establish warm handoff protocols with mental health providers. Focus on early identification and prevention of mental health crises in underserved communities.

### Differentiation Strategy

- **FIU's Unique Assets**:
  - Academic medical center expertise combined with community engagement
  - Existing NeighborhoodHELP infrastructure and community trust
  - FIU Thrive technology for screening and needs assessment
  - 15+ years serving Miami-Dade's most vulnerable populations
  - Bilingual, culturally competent workforce

- **How to Stand Out**:
  - Emphasize COMMUNITY-BASED delivery model (not clinic-based)
  - Quantify impact with data from prior NeighborhoodHELP/Thrive work
  - Demonstrate consumer engagement (advisory boards, community input)
  - Show sustainability through established partnerships and infrastructure
  - Avoid medical jargon; use language of empowerment and independence

- **Gap in Funder's Portfolio**:
  - Milbank funds primarily East Coast organizations (NY, CT, VA)
  - Limited Florida presence in recent grant lists
  - Opportunity to be Milbank's Florida partner for seniors/veterans/mental health
  - Geographic diversity strengthens foundation's national impact story

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Application Mistakes

- **Requesting multi-year funding**: Milbank ONLY funds 12-month projects. Any multi-year request = automatic decline.

- **Asking for general operating support**: Must be project-specific with defined activities, population, and outcomes.

- **Including capital or equipment costs**: No buildings, renovations, computers, or medical equipment. Supplies and materials OK, but not durable equipment.

- **Overly medical/clinical framing**: Use community-based language, not hospital/clinic terminology. Emphasize empowerment, not treatment.

- **Requesting too much as new grantee**: Start with $10,000-$50,000 for first grant. Larger requests ($75K-$100K) appropriate after successful initial relationship.

- **Vague or unmeasurable outcomes**: Must have specific, quantifiable metrics. "Improve health" is too broad; "Reduce hospital readmissions by 20%" is specific.

- **Ignoring exclusions**: Re-read exclusions list before submitting. If project includes ANY excluded elements, do not apply.

### Strategic Mistakes

- **Missing the "independence" theme**: Milbank's core mission is empowerment and self-sufficiency. Frame services as enabling independence, not creating dependency.

- **Institutional vs. community-based**: Milbank strongly prefers community-based, non-institutional services. Clinic-based programs are weak fit.

- **Weak sustainability plan**: Since no multi-year funding, must show how impact continues after 12 months. Vague sustainability = weak proposal.

- **Insufficient community voice**: Consumer-focused design is key. Show how target population shaped project design and will participate in governance.

- **Overly ambitious for budget**: $50,000 cannot support a full-time staff person for a year plus program costs. Right-size scope to match budget.

### Presentation Mistakes

- **Jargon-heavy writing**: Avoid acronyms, medical terminology, academic language. Write for intelligent lay reader.

- **Burying the alignment**: Explicitly state which Milbank priority area you address in first paragraph. Don't make reviewers hunt for it.

- **Weak connection to mission**: Reference Jeremiah Milbank's vision of "integrating people with disabilities into all aspects of American life" and show how project advances this broader mission.

- **Generic proposal**: Customize to Milbank's values and language. Don't submit boilerplate or proposals written for other funders.
